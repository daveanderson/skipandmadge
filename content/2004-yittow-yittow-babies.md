> **Mommy:** Won't it be fun when she can talk? I wonder what her first
word will be...

> **Lauryn:** Maybe "Hi" Or maybe "I had fun bein' a baby"

> **Mommy:** She'll start crawling in a little while.

> **Lauryn:** Yeah, and I know two crawling songs.

> **Mommy:** Can you sing one for me?

> **Lauryn:** Nooooo! They're not for big people. Just for yittow yittow
babies!!!
