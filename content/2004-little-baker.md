As I type this, Lauryn is receiving additional instruction from Madge on
the proper procedure for cracking, opening, and pouring eggs. Lauryn's
been cracking and emptying eggs for several months now with varied
success and usually she does a good job.

 Today they're making some sort of a fruit pie with a custard filling I
think. Madge read off the recipe, "We need three eggs." Lauryn
responded, "I could crack two, and you could crack one."

 I swear, other than regular counting I haven't done any addition,
subtraction, or multiplication lessons with her. Perhaps I should.
