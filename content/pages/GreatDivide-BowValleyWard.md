# Great Divide Canada
## Banff, Alberta to Echo Lake Montana
### 620 km in 6 days or less :)

----

The Great Divide Mountain Bike Route ([GDMBR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Divide_Mountain_Bike_Route)) is a mix of fireroads, singletrack and pavement from Banff, Alberta to Antelope Wells, New Mexico (on the US/Mexico border).  The best mountain bike riders in the world will do these 4400+ kilometers in 3-4 weeks.  This full route crosses the Continental Divide 30 times

We plan on riding 14% of this distance (620 km) in less than one week – riding the northernmost section of the route from Banff to Echo Lake (crossing the border in Roosville).

[Route Maps are available from Adventure Cycling Association](http://www.adventurecycling.org/routes/greatdivide.cfm)

### Dates: July 2 - July 7, 2012
The [Tour Divide](http://tourdivide.org) race along the GDMBR starts June 8, 2012 in Banff and Antelope Wells.  Racers will head southbound and northbound along the route, finishing 2.5 to 6 weeks later.  By the time we're on the same route, the northbound racers should have all finished.  We may run into others riding the divide, but in a non-competitive fashion.

By the start of July, the snowpack shouldn't be an obstacle.  (Last year in June, Tour Divide racers [packed snowshoes](http://singletrack.competitor.com/2011/06/photo-gallery/tour-divide-on-the-trail_17049) for the first few days…)

### Distances

Depending on the number of km ridden per day, we've determined various start points to allow arrival after 4 days of riding.

| Distance (km/day) | 55 | 80 | 100 | 125 | 140 | 157 | 210 (3 Days) | 314 (2 Days) |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|
| **Start**     | Roosville | Butts Cabin | Hwy 3 | "Y" near Elkford | Smith Dorien Rd | *Banff Springs* | Banff Springs | Banff Springs | 
| **Pace (km/h)** | 13.7   | 13.2 - 19.8 | 16.8 | 15.6 | 14.1-17.7 | *13.1-15.7-19.6* | 13.1-15.0-17.5 | 15.7-17.5-19.6 |
| **Time/Day (hours)** | 4 | 6 - 4 | 6 | 8 | 10 - 8 | *12 - 10 - 8* | 16 - 14 - 12 | 20 - 18 - 16 |

If our fitness or preparations are insufficient, we can possibly adjust the starting point.  We could also put the hammer down and get there in two long days!!

### Bikepacking
Most of the GDMBR riders have moved *away* from [panniers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pannier) and beasts of burden ([BOB](http://www.bobgear.com/ibex)) and instead follow the principles of [bikepacking](http://adventurecycling.org/features/ultralight.cfm) – off-pavement touring, often with minimal, lightweight gear.

* Food sufficient only for making it to the next resupply point (town or gas station)
* Lightweight sleeping bag, bivy sack (or light tent) and sleeping pad
* Minimal tools and equipment

**Check out this great intro to bikepacking article:  [Self Contained and Ultralight](http://www.adventurecycling.org/resources/201012_Bikepackingarticle.pdf)**

#### Bike
Though any mountain bike will do, a lightweight hardtail mountain bike (front suspension but not rear suspension) or rigid (no suspension) is recommended. [29ers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/29er_(bicycle)) are pretty trendy these days.

#### Bags
Carry as little as possible on your back and put most of the weight on your bike.  It is important to balance the weight around your bike to keep your bike handling nicely in technical terrain. 

A handlebar bag, frame bag, top tube bag and seat bag are all options.  [Relevate Designs](http://www.revelatedesigns.com) is a high quality one-stop shop for bikepacking bags.

 * handlebar bag: shelter, sleeping bag and sleeping pad
 * frame bag: food
 * top tube bag: accessible food
 * seat bag: clothes

#### Lights
We may be riding in the dark - so a proper headlamp is recommended.  The [Princeton Tech EOS](http://princetontec.com/?q=eos-bike) has a good reputation, but there are lots of alternatives and what you have might already be fine.  
**Note: July 3, 2012 will be a full moon!**

#### Navigation
Maps, cue sheets and a cycle computer are the minimum.  A GPS can be useful but adds weight.  We'll also bring a [SPOT](http://www.findmespot.ca/en/whousesspot/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=89&Itemid=38) along so we can keep our families informed of our location and condition.  An [FRS radio](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Radio_Service) each can allow the leaders and "[red lantern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanterne_rouge)" to keep in touch.

#### Clothing
The best clothing choices are light weight and packable with high tech synthetic fabric. Wear the same clothes your entire trip to save weight and space in your bags.  Good [cycling shorts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycling_shorts) (with synthetic chamois lining) are essential to minimizing chafing, saddle sores and blisters.  (Cycling shorts are designed to be worn alone with no undergarments.) [Chamois cream](http://www.bicycling.com/beginners/bikes-gear/8-great-chamois-creams) might be helpful too.  

We'll mostly just be riding, so a few layers and an outer shell are probably all that is needed.

A change of clothes waiting for you in Echo Lake are also needed.

#### Hydration
Bladders and bottles in your backpack or frame bag and bottles attached to your bike are the places to store fluid. How much to carry depends on your speed, time to next resupply point and temperatures.  We'll probably resupply on the trail as available, so purification tablets or a filter can be used - but filters are heavier!

#### Sleep System
Light weight and packable are the keys. The basics are a sleeping pad, bivvy bag and sleeping bag. A lighter and riskier option is to take nothing! A heavier and comfier option is to add a tent or tarp.
