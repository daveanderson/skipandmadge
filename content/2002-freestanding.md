Last night we visited Ryan and Camila at their Aunt and Uncle's home.
They are house-sitting and we went over for the evening. After dinner,
when we were playing with Satchmo, a Standard Schnauzer, Lauryn,
excited by the dog, suddenly stood up on her own.

She stood there for
about 10 seconds before she decided to sit down again. Several times she
defied the tendance to fall over and stood, unassisted, for several
seconds.
