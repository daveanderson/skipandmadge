Beyond just posting about interesting software that I'm interested in or
can't live without, I also like food. Actually, if I could typically go
without eating, I would. But, when I'm interested in food, I quite enjoy
it and especially enjoy food of quality, not necessarily quantity.

 So here's a recipe that I found on the Internet (via [slashfood](http://www.slashfood.com/2005/10/04/food-porn-nigellas-chocolate-brownies/)),
that Madge first made, and that I've now made once (with pointers from
Madge). These are, according to my tastes, very good brownies. I'd say
that they're "the best ever" but that's a tough judgement call until
I've tried every brownie recipe in existance. These are definitely a
contender. And I expect Nigella is [Nigella Lawson](http://www.nigella.com/).

###Nigella's Brownies

* 1 2/3 cup soft unsalted butter
* 13 ounces (368.5 grams) of very fine chocolate (I used Lindt 70% Cocoa Chocolate - each bar is 100g, and some Chipits chocolate chips)
* 6 large eggs
* 1 tablespoon vanilla
* 1 2/3 cup sugar
* 1 1/2 cup all purpose flour
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1 1/3 cup chopped pecans (or walnuts - yuck!) (I'd say optional)
    
* Preheat the oven to 350Â°F.
* Line your brownie pan (13x9") with parchment paper. This is a little extra step but makes the brownie a breeze to get out of the pan....
* Melt the butter and chocolate together over medium-low heat. Let this cool a bit after melting.
* Mix together the eggs, sugar and vanilla in a large bowl.
* Measure the flour into another bowl along with the salt. (I used a 2 cup measuring cup and then added the salt directly to the measuring cup and stirred.)
* Mix together the cooled chocolate/butter mixture and the eggs/sugar mixture. 
* Add in the nuts (I didn't - I left them out). 
* Mix in the flour and beat to combine smoothly
* Scrape into lined pan.
* Bake for 25 (35-40?) minutes and be vigilant. Brownies can go from delish to dry in about 2 minutes.... They will continue to cook a bit as they cool....

25 minutes just wasn't long enough. I ended up baking them for closer to 35-40 - until a knife could be inserted in the center and the batter would just barely cling.
