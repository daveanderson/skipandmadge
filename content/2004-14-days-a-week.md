In French, there are two ways to refer to the amount of time we, in
English, refer to as a week. First is the straightforward "une semaine"
or "one week." However, in conversation it is more common for people to
refer to a week as "huit jours" or "eight days." Now if you count the
days, from say Wednesday until and **including** the next Wednesday, you
will count eight days. I don't know if this is the logical origin, but
if someone, on a Friday, says they'll see you in "huit jours," show up
at the specified time on Friday, not Saturday.

 Similarly, "quinze jours" is equivalent to two weeks (or a fortnight),
and not the two-weeks-plus-one-day that you may expect. Lauryn, however,
has her own non-French, non-"English" way of counting days.

 She eats breakfast 14 times a week, and never has dinner/supper. Each
one of our days is, in Lauryn's world, comprised of breakfast, lunch,
nap, breakfast and another (long) nap. Consequently it has been very
challenging to teach her the concept of "days of the week."

 However, while she knows that once it gets dark at night its time to go
to bed, she **doesn't** fight the afternoon nap despite the fact that
its **not** dark. No complaints here.
