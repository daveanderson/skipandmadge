Wordpress Blues

I've done no less than 5 separate Wordpress installs, and each one has
worked flawlessly... that is, except for this one.
 If you've visited anytime in say, **the last month**, you will probably
have been shocked to see just 1995-style text.?Ç¬? No colours, borders,
nice fonts, nada.?Ç¬? For the first couple of weeks of wackiness, I
tried a few things to fix the problem.?Ç¬? I could fix it momentarily,
but soon the links to the `css stylesheet`_, which nicely converts
boring text to flashy layout, would become broken.?Ç¬?
 Finally today I gave up, `backed up my install`_, deleted the database,
and then restored just the content (and none of the potentially messed
up settings).?Ç¬? I've also switched to a lemony theme.?Ç¬? I'll
definitely modify it, but its a start.
 Welcome back to the 21st century.
