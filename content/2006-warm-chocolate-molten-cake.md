During our time in San Diego a couple (and their daughter) quickly
befriended us, and gave us the opportunity to go surfing a couple of
times. We always had lots of fun together and had a lot in common.

 After one dinner party (or other outing) the topic of desserts came up
and they said they knew one of the best, richest, most delicate, dark
chocolate desserts. Naturally we had to schedule a follow-up dinner
party during which we made these.

 Thanks to Cameron and Lisa for introducing us to this one (and their
hospitality). Now I just need to document the rules to their addictive
dice game.
