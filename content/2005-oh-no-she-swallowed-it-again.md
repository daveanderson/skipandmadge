More than two years ago I bought Lauryn a dolly. If you squeeze its
hand or tummy it makes little cooing or crying sounds. At first she
was scared of it. Then just disinterested. But in the past two
weeks she's really gotten into "Mommying" her baby. Her name is
"Charlie".

 After playing with and talking about the baby doll today, this sequence
spilled out.

> Lauryn: She's sad because she has a sore tummy
> 
> Mom: Why does she have a sore tummy?

> Lauryn: Because she has a hard spot in her tummy

> Mom: How did she get a hard spot in her tummy?

> Lauryn: Betause she swallowed a bee.

> Mom: Did she mean to swallow a bee?

> Lauryn: Nope, it just buzzed right in

> Mom: Oh.

> Lauryn: I need to det (get) her some medicine to make it better

> Lauryn: (Leaves and comes back.) I have the medicine

> Mom: Did you get it from the Doctor?

> Lauryn: Nope, I just found it. I would give it to her (runs away
with the doll).

> Audible: \*slurp\*
> 
> Lauryn: (Runs back) She needed FOUR parts of medicine. Now I have
to burp her. (Pat, pat, pat, pat...)

> Mom: You take good care of your dolly
> 
> Lauryn: I knowed how

> Audible: \*burp\*

> Lauryn: The bee flew out.

> Mom: It did?

> Lauryn: With her burp. Oh, no, she swallowed it again.
