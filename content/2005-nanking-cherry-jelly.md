I grew up eating most anything. I'm not talking about food served at the
table, but generally anything that could possibly be considered edible,
I've probably tried or would be willing to try.

 My brother almost fooled me into taking a finger-lick of grease after
he opened a new tube for the grease-gun and he told me it was chocolate
pudding. I also once ate a bee that had been squished by a french
dictionary and two encyclopedias (for a bit less than $10). I've eaten
every sort of grass or plant imaginable. And I've tried most berries
(early on I was told to stay away from Buffalo Beans - AKA golden
bean/buck bean/yellow pea/Golden Pea/False Lupine).

 Basically, after a long hot day at the farm, anything will taste good.
 
 I can only eat a small quantity of [Alfalfa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfalfa) before the taste starts
to bother me (its rather "rich" in flavour - like its full of minerals).
Pulling most any grass/grain apart will reveal a tender section that's
quite pleasant. Many flowers taste OK - [Roses](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose) are on the bottom of my
list (but [rose hips](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose_hips) are good - esp. from the Alberta Wild Rose),
[Carnations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnation) are at the top. (I once played a dinner-game where the
goal of the game was to eat the carnation out of the centerpiece vase
without anyone outside of the participants noticing. I didn't win, and I
didn't even notice the winner making the move). I've licked sap, chewed
on bark, eaten leaves, you name it. But berries are the best.

 I once went camping with some people who wanted to go for a hike over
some rolling prairie hills. Climbing out of one valley I noticed some
[Saskatoon berry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juneberry) bushes, announced their presence, and started picking
and eating. The camp leaders were astonished at my stupidity - eating
something that was just growing out of the hillside. They couldn't
possibly fathom that something so delicious could "just grow" out in the
middle of nowhere. After a great amount of convincing (backed up by the
quantity I was enjoying) everyone soon began to participate. (I also
love [Chokecherries](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chokecherry), but it was too early in the year for them to be
ripe.)

 Living in France it wasn't uncommon for me to hop off my bike and just
start eating the [blackberries](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackberry) that seemed to grow on every hedgerow.
They were delicious in August (and otherwise wasted).

 Yesterday, we went for a walk through the park, enjoying this glorious
warm weather. Heading up the hill toward Dama's house, Madge spotted
some [Nanking Cherry](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Prunus_tomentosa) bushes covered in ripe berries. (She was
initially shocked as well when I claimed I recognized these "berries"
several years ago and began eating them.) We used Lauryn's hat and soon
had it filled with the sweet round cherries. Madge had the plan of
making jelly, and this evening we followed through. It is
***delicious***. For reference I'm listing the recipe. I think we didn't
need as much pectin as the recipe calls out. (We used Bernardin Pectin -
a 57g box). Next time I think we'll cut it in half and see how that
does.
