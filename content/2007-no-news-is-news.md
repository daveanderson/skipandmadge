For all those who voted on when our baby would arrive, most of you
surely didn't win.

 He's hanging on inside longer than any of us expected, though we all
doubt *he*'ll hold out until Monday. At least his birthday won't fall on
our anniversary or Sophie's birthday.

 Our midwives joke that, "It takes longer to make the handle".
