A week in Waterton among friends and family. Such bliss...

 After having my SCSI card die and prevent my machine from booting, I
was able to ditch work for a week and go to Waterton. Participating in a
family reunion, I enjoyed reencountering friends, who are now family,
that I haven't seen for 5 to 7 years. It was fantastic.

 I surprised myself by coming in 2nd in a 5 km fun run, and by being 2nd
in a race to the top of Bear's Hump and down. Talk about stiff legs the
next day! I could hardly walk, with inclines and declines becoming
nearly impossible navigate so bad was my stiffness.

 Too bad I had to pay Waterton sale prices to buy a pair of shoes to run
in...

 Another lesson I learned, not the hard way, was that canoes remain
stable only while being used properly. That is, two friends tried to
participate in a canoe race by paddling their canoe backwards - using
the tail end of the canoe at the front. They ended up in the freezing
lake and had to be "rescued."
