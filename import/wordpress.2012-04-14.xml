<content:encoded><![CDATA[Lauryn was up early this morning and seemed to be in a lot of pain.  After wailing for 15 minutes we gave her some Tylenol and she settled down in half an hour.  
Then she wanted to play.  She played all happy and fun for another hour while Brenda and I fell into and out of sleep.  Then she yawned so I put her back to bed and I started tweaking this blog some more.

Quicktime 6 was released last night so I tried to modify my script to batch convert .mp3 files into .mp4 files.  It hasn't worked yet, unless you want to say 'yes' to every file that you save.  I'm having trouble with the file references and alias' to the saving location.
Applescript is rather challenging with regard to that for me.

I'm going to help my brother-in-law Mike with his Scout camp, and I have to make sure I have all the equipment necessary for two rappelling lines.  I'm still working on that.  And I should be getting at my Xfree86 modifications for e-complex.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Feeling the desire to keep a basic log of my thoughts, ideas, actions and emotions, I joined in the growing trend of creating a weblog.

I have, to some degree, come to a reasonable design.  I don't like to tweak html for hours on end, and as I have done so, I leave my changes as they are coded.

I've been spending my days enjoying the company of Brenda and Lauryn, as well as working with Ryan and Matt on a project with e-complex.  Its coming along quite nicely.  Hopefully tomorrow I will be able to enact some of the changes that I have been planning on and preparing for.  Xfree86 is a complex beast, hopefully I don't break it along the way.

see you tomorrow...]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[So today was the Apple Macworld keynote.  OS 10.2 (Jaguar) looks good, and though I like the idea of multiple calendars and a nice calendar program, I don't understand the idea of web-publishing your personal calendar.  Not unless there was some sort of publish subscribe model where you could update it from any computer anywhere.  Such a scheme would make good use of a wireless internet connection.

The $100US subscription to .Mac services is a great way to turn iChat into a $100US instant messaging client.  Grrr...  Looks like I'll be setting up mail services here at skipandmadge.com for myself, and perhaps even my own webmail service.  I just can't justify it.  I have not found the iDisk to be THAT useful yet (but it seemed to be just getting fast enough).  All the OS X references to "Connect to iDisk..." have now become bloat.

However, the mpeg4 quicktime stream of the keynote was fantastic.  Clear, clean, audio in sync.  It finally worked the way streaming video is supposed to work.  
I'm interested in acquiring the new remote for my iPod, as well as making use of the enhanced calendar functionality.  If only they could use the scroll wheel to move through a list of characters so you could modify contact info on the iPod.  

Another iPod improvement I'm interested in would be the ability to build ad-hoc (on-the-fly) playlists.  Go into an "ad-hoc playlist" mode and then just scroll through the music using the select button to select upcoming songs.  Then go back to "ad-hoc playlist" and switch out of that mode for regular functionality.  Pick the playlist, and you have an on the spot grouping of music, suitable for the most random moments.
You could even go into a "modify playlist mode" and move songs up and down in the playlist.  Though it may not be the simplest of interfaces it shouldn't be that hard to build it in a reasonably clear manner.

Interested in making the most of the 10GB on my iPod, I've been working on an applescript that will convert .mp3s to .mp4s.  I could potentially make it convert from .aiff (directly off a CD?) but I haven't tried of yet.  Get it <a href="http://www.skipandmadge.com/downloads/3pmp4.sit">here.</a> The readme briefly outlines how it works (and the bug it has).

I'm also having difficulty compiling Xfree86 after my last round of changes, wired errors when I #include items that may already be #included...]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[My trip camping this weekend involved me getting a nice sunburn on my neck.  I also banged up my shins nicely.  I went to help give the kids a chance to do some rappelling.  I ended up making it possible for one of the leaders to remain on the camp.  That is, Mike, Brenda's brother, tore a muscle in his calf and could not go up and down the steep valley wall from the "road" to the camp sites.  A zip line had been erected to "drop" supplies and equipment into the valley, but was too steep to send people on safely.  So I rigged up a system to belay Mike on the zip line.  We tied a harness that would fit him and lowered him into the valley.  There he remained until the next morning.  I couldn't return home that night, as I would need to set up a pulley system to extricate him from the valley.  That night, using crevass rescue techniques from "Mountaineering, Freedom of the Hills" I built a Z pulley system using pullies and two ascenders that would give us a 3 to 1 mechanical advantage.  So the next morning, after staying up until 4am supervising some kids hanging out by the fire, we had a relatively simple time hauling Mike out.

Friday night at camp also gave me a chance to lash another chair.  Several years ago I built a chair.  I remembered some of the flaws in the previous design and build a recliner chair that was quite comfortable.  I should draw up the design (with directions) for future reference.  

Arriving in Calgary at 4:00pm I found that Brenda had travelled with Ryan and Camila to the "Two Creek" ranch south of Longview.  They had left instructions with me to come out for the rest of the evening.  I was dead tired, but didn't want to miss out on a good time, so I showered and jumped in Ryan and Cam's car and drove for an hour out to the ranch.  I scared myself by almost falling asleep on the way, but after a while the road turned to gravel and I was alert and enjoying the scenic view of the foothills.  The ranch is a nice quite place down in a valley where creeks join.  What a wonderful place.  We saw horses, deer, and I badly wanted to go play in the large pool where the two creeks meet, but Lauryn was pretty sleepy and it was time to go.  I was glad to go out there, despite my fatigue.  Perhaps some other time I'll have the opportunity to go out there and work with some of their cattle.  While I don't want to be a farmer/rancher full time, I certainly would enjoy helping someone else out from time to time.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last night we visited Ryan and Camila at their Aunt and Uncle's home.  They are house-sitting and we went over for the evening.

She stood there for about 10 seconds before she decided to sit down again.  Several times she defied the tendance to fall over and stood, unassisted, for several seconds.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Several days of without an entry eh?  You sure you're cut out for this 'blogging hobby?  

Overcoming my work problems with getting X to compile, I've been busy being busy.  Lauryn is free standing more and more but only takes 1 step before she gets scared and sits down.

And my hair, courtesy of Cari, has been trimmed.  I should run faster now.

A major reason for my tardyness is an eMac.  Tuesday I purchased, for my parents, a 700 MHz <a href="http://www.apple.com/emac/">eMac</a> and after installing a couple of apps, I set it up to convert .wmf files to .ai.  Boy that is a slow process.  I'm trying to convert the Print Shop library of images to an Illustrator format.  Slow going ...  

So tonight we'll be heading south to deliver the eMac to my parents.  Hopefully they can enjoy it.  Its a nice machine.  When ram prices drop I'll have to get them more RAM.
... and setting up my own email server has proven to be a slow process...]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[So I've sent and received several emails to/from my mom on her new eMac.  She has only "lost" one message thusfar.  I think she accidentally moved the mouse while holding down the button and selected the entire message and then deleted it by typing another word.  Perhaps I should explain the concept of "Undo" to her, as I don't think it is a concept that she is familiar with.  Her inexperience with "mousing" and the "no-button" apple mouse makes it easy for her to click and drag while simply trying to move the cursor.  Finally a flaw with Apple simplicity.  Clicking without trying.  

As well, I finally have my DNS and webserver settings figured out so <a href="http://skip.skipandmadge.com">skip.skipandmadge.com</a> now points to this exact page.  Perhaps I should put that link in my email signature to "spread the word" a bit more.  That would necessarily mean that someone other than myself would have to find this blog interesting.

Note to self:  Email your brother]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Well, my CD burner appears to have problems.  I'm not sure why but it will never correctly burn a cd image.  Looks like a good excuse to get a <a href="http://www.apple.com/imac/superdrive.html">SuperDrive</a>.  But being poor as I am, it probably isn't going to happen any time soon.  

And the green beans are ready for picking, so before I go to work I think I am going to go pick a few.  Yum.  Fuzzy Fresh Green Beans.  Our corn is looking good, albeit very short, with about 4 cobs per plant.  The recent rain should hopefully let the cobs fill out.

And people said you can't grow corn in Calgary!  (Well, we're still waiting to disprove that, and it's probably not very relevant to most people.  Good thing its relevant to me, right?)]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[A week in Waterton among friends and family.  Such bliss...

After having my SCSI card die and prevent my machine from booting, I was able to ditch work for a week and go to Waterton.  Participating in a family reunion, I enjoyed reencountering friends, who are now family, that I haven't seen for 5 to 7 years.  It was fantastic.

I surprised myself by coming in 2nd in a 5 km fun run, and by being 2nd in a race to the top of Bear's Hump and down.  Talk about stiff legs the next day!  I could hardly walk, with inclines and declines becoming nearly impossible navigate so bad was my stiffness.

Too bad I had to pay Waterton sale prices to buy a pair of shoes to run in...

Another lesson I learned, not the hard way, was that canoes remain stable only while being used properly.  That is, two friends tried to participate in a canoe race by paddling their canoe backwards - using the tail end of the canoe at the front.  They ended up in the freezing lake and had to be "rescued."]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[So the my broken tooth is being repaired.  Today was the grind and freeze part of the job.  In 11 days I get my crown.  Apparently there was a large and nasty cavity under the dislodged filling.

I have these friends that want to go caving.  I would act as guide and they would come along, but the scheduling just isn't working.  One is moving, and having the movers come this weekend, the other has school a week from friday.  I had wanted to make it a 3 day affair, but who knows if any of it will happen now.  Mostly I just want to get out and tramp around a mountain.  Another friend that I would like to come, already has the next few weekends booked.  Ah, well, what can you do?

And if you're thinking of getting new wheels and bearings for your rollerblades, just don't do it.  Just get new skates.  Unless I totally looked in the wrong place, $50 for wheels and $40 for bearings.  My used skates only cost me $45 in the first place.  When I get rich I'll just have to get new skates.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Friday was a beautiful day.  The sun shone like photons from a nearby star, the wind blew like gas molecules excited by diferences in surface temperature.  Dave, not I, wanted to go caving before starting the next semester of school.  Thus, the swirling molecules and photons of light influenced my decisions such that we left the city at 17:00 and commenced our 7+km hike at 20:05.  Along the 4x4 trail we marched and soon we arrived at the steep trail to our campsite.  2 and 2/3 hours after abandoning the Kia we arrived at the Plateau and enjoyed the welcoming scent of burning pine logs.  Near some other cavers, and their dwindling campfire, we unfurled our sleeping bags and positioned ourselves perpendicular to pull of gravity. 

The heat of the August night, combined with the plush environ of a subzero (-20) down sleeping bag, made comfort a fleeting affair.  Exposing myself to the fragrant mountain air quickly relieved the building warmth within the bag, but one could not sleep and carry on the duty of temperature regulation all night.  Eventually a position of sleeping half in the bag, and half exposed, produced a sufficient radiator effect to allow prolonged rest, yet my left hip ached in the morn due to the constant evening chill it endured.

The gooey taste of instant oatmeal, and the heady smell of turkey sausages enlived this pair of hikers sufficent to seemingly sprint up the mountainside to Cleft - the cave with the carrot-shaped entrance.  Inside, attempting to follow another group of speologists, we took a left turn and followed an icy (ice flows and crystals on the walls) passage to what appeared to be the end of the road.  A small hole in the floor/wall, suggested a possible continuance, and when combined with the recollection of stories of a "squeeze hole" through to a larger passage and the ugly signatures of previous touristic adventures in this room we decided to try it out.  I then flopped on my back and stuck my head in the hole and discovered that indeed a larger passage did lie beyone this limestone sphincter.  Wriggling through I beckoned to Dave who followed.  Continuing along this passage we soon felt the warmth of August air and knew that we must be readily approaching one of Cleft's two lookouts.

These windows to the valley opposite the entrance, are some 600 feet (at least) above the scree below.  Carefully peaking over the jaggged edge we basked in the warmth of the surterranian world for only a minute or two before skulking back into the inky blackness.  Near the window we had noticed a small passage heading east.  This we decided to take in the hopes of making the "loop" of which others had spoken.  Crawling a short distance along this passage, I soon heard the sound, and voiced, of the other party.  Reaching a spot where the small passage widened, we crawled up onto a shelf and waited for the other group of seven to pass.  Chatting briefly we learned that they had headed to the other window first and so we were meeting midway through the loop of seeing both lookouts.  Once they continued on to where we had just been, we crawled forward on to the portion of the cave that we had not yet seen.  Soon this small tunel became icy, with frozen pools of water on the floor.  At times this passage would probably make traversers quite wet.  For us it was closer to an ice slide as we decended to the main passage in front of us.  Appearing in the familiar main passage, we continued through a tall and skinny section of the cave to the second window.  It is far less of an enjoyable spot than the first, as the floor slopes steeply to the cliff edge, and to get near the edge you must brace yourself against the narrow walls to feel safe.

Thus having reached both lookouts, we turned around headed for the other side of the mountain - the entrance.  Arriving we stowed our underground gear and prepared to descend.  Soon the other party emerged and, having brought significantly less equipment than us mules, began the descent to the main camp area.  The youngest member of their party attempted to run down the scree slope and, allowing his upper body to travel faster down the mountain than his feet, fell head over heels down the slope.  After one revolution he managed to slide on his back to a stop.  The rest of his party rush to his aid, but he quickly stood and appear, from our distance, to be alright.  Certainly he was bruised and a bit battered, but after a several minute rest he then limped off the mountainside.

Needless to say we were careful in our descent of the same section.  However, before descending to the campsite, we stopped to fill our water bottles.  Leaving mine wedged between some rocks to catch the drips, I scampered up the mountainside above the cave entrance in the hopes of sseing an easy route over the mountain into the opposite valley where lies the entrance to Gargantua and Yorkshire Pot.  I believe I know the way, but making this trip by myself was not in the agenda.  Thus after scoping out the surroundings I descended to the watering hole where Dave and I hoisted our packs and descended.

We intended to quickly retrieve the belongings remaining at our campsite and thence continue back down the mountain and out the 4x4 trail to the Kia.  Our hasty attempt to leave was halted by a choice encounter with the father and son responsible for digging out the bottom end of Yorkshire Pot completing the fabled "through trip" of one of Canada's longest (19km?) caves.  Naturally this cave is rather labyrinthine and the through trip does not necessitate covering all of those 19 kilometers.  We learned of the exit and its location, and were able to find out some truths about this cave.  We also learned of the existance and documentation of other caves in the area.  What a great chance to learn more and from what a great source! 

Soon we departed and slowly descended the mountain on our sore legs and feet.  The kilometers passed and soon we arrived, tired an happy at the silver Kia.  Home was but a 3 hour drive away.

I'm not certain when next I'll be heading to that area, but certainly a trip to the bottom of Yorkshire Pot is on the horizon.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[So, due to various reasons beyond my control this site has been inaccessible for about a month.  Well, its back now, and you can now find us via Google.  However the only reason Google knows about this place is due to the mp3's that are also being shared here.  If Google gets to know too much, I'll have to remove the mp3's and they will be accessible only via other means.  Just search for skipandmadge at Google.com

School is going rather well... Enough said.
Climbing is not happening often enough.
Lauryn is growing up like a fair skinned sunflower.
And my favorite caving spot is now a nationally known rescue site.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>A list of equipment requirements for tossing 24 girls off a cliff.</h4>  <br> I'm going to be showing some 12-13 year old girls how to rappel on Wednesday so here's my procedure and equipment list.<br /><br />2 sessions of 20-24 girls<br />2 ropes - using one static line for both "ropes."  The routes are side by side so girls will have to go down in pairs.<br />I run the second rope, Ryan runs the first (with Brenda to assist at the bottom)<br /><br /><b>Instruction Steps</b><br /><b>1 Introduction</b><br />Bring the girls to the face - most often people go up it and its a lot of work.  A similar sensation occurs when you go down.  Its an easy way to start.  Has anyone done this before?<br />There are 3 rules:<br />i) Don't step on the rope<br />ii) Don't drop the metal equipment - it can get cracks so fine that you can only see it with and XRay  (I should xray my equipment at work sometime for fun)<br />iii) Double check each other - Check each other.  Checking is what eliminates the danger of the situation.  If everything is done up correctly, you're more likely to get hurt driving here than doing this.<br /><br />And one more rule:<br />Everyone can try as often as we have time, but no one HAS to do it.  I would hope that everyone will try at least once - unless you try, you'll never know what you're missing.  Don't worry if you're scared, I was terrified the first time I tried it back when I was 12.  Now I'm hooked.<br /><br /><b>2 Explain the equipment</b><br />Harness - how to put it on - double back the buckles.  Everyone helps each other put them on and check each other.  <br />Carabiner, figure 8 - explain the friction.  Have the rope run through and demonstrate (&amp; the lingo too -&gt; on rope, on belay, off belay, off rope)<br /><br /><b>3 Explain how it will work</b><br />Two ready on top, two on rope, two at bottom as safety, four on deck (first two showing the next two how to put on the harness &amp; check)<br /><br />Equipment list<br />8-10 harnesses<br />8-10 locking 'biners<br />8-10 helmets<br />4 slings<br />1 static rope<br />1 dynamic rope<br /><br />Each girl should take less than, but not more than (hopefully) 5 minutes from top to bottom to off rope.<br /><br />Estimate time requirement for 20 girls to each go once and 10 of them to go two times<br />(this is assuming only one rope is in use)<br />20 girls  x 5 minutes = 100 minutes (1 hour 40 minutes)<br />10 girls x 5 minutes = 50 minutes (combined with the 20 girls = 150 minutes = 2 hours 30 minutes)  <br />]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>Summertime addiction to seeing the countryside of France</h4> So we're 10 days into the Tour de France and yesterday was an eventful day.  Check <a href="http://www.eurosport.com/home/pages/V3/L0/multimedia_Lng0.shtml">this</a> (Stage 9 highlights).  Unfortunately it requires RealPlayer. Remind me not to break my Femur in the same manner.  The race ended yesterday in <a href="http://www.mapquest.com/maps/map.adp?zoom=3&amp;mapdata=IMR0dTEnVx47%2fsn5Df%2bwCFzkm5WBZDMhh8iLvndQh%2fuvqlnqBy5n9rULydK%2bLndnDhS9N7eRZzmW69Vn%2f3DOZacJeiL0jrVoCTon%2b4503P2OwGq53%2fQ3So8bal5N7dQn1JYorXXOabbIlXFnGOeZAgJmDqw%2fc%2bQNj%2fxSDDBoIhBXgSMz7i0JM82PbjXmAYupamKPFJ61kBjyjxQHaKe2q4huYZ5FpQ1e6Gz9z4AcpftMr1W2R6adGuCQK1V1nBNo1ztAmuEad4ZJ0alxaUZN5fMZUvDMeeAGOp7lGA2di0tAkW3bZjQ6Z%2fNNeCZL%2fq0%2fFBw20zDSzORM7ffdd6yLsg%3d%3d">Gap</a> and I have a friend, Jean-Luc Guitton from Gap.  Well, this morning, after not having seen or conversed with him for over 4 years, I got an email from him this morning.  He's moving close to Paris, away from his beloved south of France, and is getting married soon.  Quite the interesting coincidence. <br /><br />I'm anxious about going back to France, but I'm wondering if I should hold off until next year when I can go and SEE the Tour live...  I'd go up on one of the mountain passes in the Pyrenees I think.  It would be a blast.<br /><br />Time to save my shekels.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Yesterday was the trip to the mountains to teach some 12 and 13 year old girls how to rappel.  It really went quite well.  <a href="http://www.biffard.com">Ryan</a> and Madge were my assistants with <a href="http://www.biffard.com/family/may24/img_8624.htm">Lilo</a> filling out the cute requirement.  Two groups of about 21 girls, and some of their leaders rapped a 22' face in <a href="http://www.rockclimbing.com/routes/listArea.php?AreaID=3676">Heart Creek</a>.  They all followed directions very well and all but 4 or 5 of the girls rappelled, many of them multiple times. 

It was a a beautiful sunny day, so it was nice to not be at work.  Lilo, having seen all these other girls come down the mountainside, wanted to do it too.  She asked to go up the mountain, and asked to have a harness.  I tied a little harness around her pamper butt and clipped a bent gate 'biner onto it so she'd be just like everyone else.  She marched around happily for a while, and then asked to "climb" too.  I lifted her up onto the the wall, about 5 feet up, put a rope through her rappelling device, and held onto her as I let her slide down the wall.  Just because you're 2 years old doesn't mean you can't do everything the big kids do!

In-between groups, Ryan and I had time to climb two routes.  The first was an easy 5.9 and the second a sort and dirty 5.11c(<a href="http://www.rockclimbing.com/routes/listSection.php?SectionID=5233">Voodoo Lounge</a> ).  I managed to do the 11c last year, but I haven't climbed for about 5 months and my strength and endurance has suffered.  I lead partway up it first, and worked at THE move until I was exhausted.  Ryan then made it on his second try.  I tried again and failed, so Ryan red-pointed it and cleaned the route.

Once we were done at Heart Creek, he and I hiked off into the bush in search of some boulders I had heard about.  The quick and dirty map that Mike made for us was surprisingly accurate.The boulders were a collection of a conglomerate upheaval in the middle of a mostly flat pine forest.  They were 90% covered in thick <a href="http://www.lichen.com/">lichen</a> that was unsuitable for climbing (plus we see no need in destroying nature just to develop more climbing areas).  The two good barespots we found were tough enough for us to play on until neither of us could bare to touch the rock anymore, as the rough <a href="http://www.hf.uio.no/iakk/roger/lithic/conglomerate.html">conglomerate</a> (and tiny crimpers) were murderous on the fingertips.  I was not successful on the second problem, but made some headway after many attempts.  If more of the rock were bare, this collection of 5-8 boulders would be a nice little area.  

Photos of the area can be found <a href="http://www.biffard.com/climbing/july16/index.htm">here</a>.  I am in the blue shirt, Ryan (as always) in yellow, and Dave (who showed up for the last hour) is in green.]]></content:encoded>

After too much fiddling over the past two days I now have movabletype installed on a base 10.3 install.  Mostly it is straightforward but configuring mysql is definitely my weak point.  I had to use Navicat (http://www.mysqlstudio.com/mac_detail.php3) to configure the users and permissions.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[So I've not been content to just get MovableType installed, I also wanted to make use of this <a href="http://nilesh.org/mt/blogtimes/">blogtimes</a> plugin.  

Unfortunately it depends on the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~lds/GD-2.05/">GD perl module</a> which depends on the presence of libgd.  libgd isn't installed by default on OS X <yet> so after trying to avoid it (as I'm just rather afraid of it) for some time I looked to see if <a href="http://fink.sourceforge.net/">Fink</a> had it (I was pushed toward Fink after seeing <a href="http://www.bugzilla.org/docs214/html/osx.html">this Bugzilla post </a> .)

Fink had a copy but it hasn't been built for <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">Panther</a> yet so I took a gamble and went to the <a href="http://www.boutell.com/gd/"> libgd maintainer's site</a> and grabbed the source.  After running the makefile, well, it said that I didn't have libpng or libjpeg (but I didn't care about libjpeg).  Fink this time did have a 10.3 (Panther) build of libpng so I installed it via Fink.  (I tried to build it on my own from the source but failed and didn't want to figure it out.)

Now comes to the reason why I love to avoid Fink.  It installs packages in /sw instead of /usr or /usr/local and then when you want to build something (like say libgd or the GD perl module) you have to know how to tweak the configure files or environment variables or... (I just don't know what all) so that the makefiles will work in /sw/include and /sw/lib.

Needless to say this process just isn't clear to me yet.

But the hack that I am, I made it work.  I finally got the libgd ./configure to find my libpng install and I built and installed libgd successfully into /usr/local/lib.

Next (it was hard to even remember what I was trying to get at in the first place), I followed the bugzilla patch (link above) to successfully install the GD perl module via cpan ('look GD' instead of 'install GD' and a reasonable dose of emacs).

I then grabbed the MovableType plugin and placed it in the plugin folder for MT, copied the sample tags and voila!
  <img src="http://www.skipandmadge.com/images/blogtimes.png" width="410" height="56" border="0" alt="B L O G T I M E S" title="B L O G T I M E S" />

But when I rebuild this index page with MT, I get an error :(   Poop, more debugging, but as you can see, its late and I need to ride my bike to work tomorrow.

At least this project worked unlike that time I tried to build Gnome2.2 from scratch... BAH!

[Update 2003-11-18 01:50:44]  I had an improper path to the 'save_dir'.  Well, it was an empty path so the html had a path to http://www.skipandmadge.com//blogtimes.png instead of http://www.skipandmadge.com/images/blogtimes.png  

Just another testimony of the power of lost sleep.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[So I'm trying to incorporate a previous design into this design and well, its coming along but it takes time.  Sorry about the mess.  I'm thinking of going for a mostly graphic-less layout.  Hopefully I can make this all work nicely with the major browsers.  Safari and Firebird are ok thusfar, but I had a problem with IE6.  Grrr, now I remember why I don't do this for a living.

I'm going down to San Diego for work tomorrow to learn about some parts we'll be using in our next design.  Hopefully I'll get a chance to check out an <a href="http://www.apple.com/retail/utc/">Apple Store</a> and poke around.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[So if anyone visited this page over the past weekend (and they were using IE6 or IE5 on Windows) they would have seen the blog (text) portion of the sight going under the images and links on the right hand side.  

If anyone really wants to know how I fixed it, I got rid of the "position:absolute" css propertly for the center column and have the text margins set to the width of the sidebars.  At least I didn't have to do some silly hack to get around it.  Here's hoping that I can get a design I like without resolving to browser detection and css hacks.  Standards should JUST WORK!

Why doesn't everyone implement CSS the same?

Oh and San Diego was nice and warm (pleasant) but I didn't get to the beach or ride the wooden rollercoaster.   I did get to the applestore however and figured out that will the improved strength of the CDN dollar (US dollar weakness) I could have saved $270 CDN by purchasing a <a href="http://www.apple.com/powerbook/index15.html">PowerBook</a> south of the border.  GST on such a purchase would be $240 CDN so it would really work out to just paying the list price (sans GST).]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I've been trying to ride my bike to work as much as possible (3 or 4 days a week) and hope to ride through the entire winter.  Unfortunately my bike has been driving me absolutely crazy.  Acutally its not the bike so much as the tires and tubes.  Since I began riding in August, I have had no less than 7 flat tires.  These aren't punctures, they're valve stem separations or tears.  <br />
Basically what seems to happen is as I ride the tire shifts (rotates) on the rim. As it does so it pulls the tube with it.  The valve stem is fixed in place so as the tube moves with the tire, the rubber stretches on one side of the valve stem until it tears  or the valve stem separates.  <br />
I've tried multiple tube brands, doublesided tape to stick the tube and tire to the rim, and spray on adhesive. <br />
I'm getting sick of the impending flat tire I will have either leaving from work or coming to work.  I need this problem fixed.  My next attempt will be to coat the inside of the tire (and the outside of the tube) with baby powder so as to eliminate tube/tire friction.  Then if the tire does shift on the rim, it won't pull the tube along with it.  Grrrrr.
<br />

On another note, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=skipandmadge">skipandmadge.com</a> now shows up if you google for "skipandmadge."   Hopefully by continually adding more content it will keep getting indexed by the search engines.
<br />And I do intend to continue modifying the layout, but work has been far too busy.  (ie.  I've been putting in long work hours and working thorough lunch thereby leaving no extra time for fiddling.)]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[The baby powder seems to have worked.  I don't know if/when I'll need to give it another dose but three days of riding now and no flats or crooked valve stems.  Now all I need are my <a href="http://cambriabike.com/SALE/pedal/crank_bros_egg_beater_pedals_02.htm">new pedals</a> to come in and for a pair of biking shoes to show up and I'll be crusing to and from work in comfort (relatively speaking).  

If I continue to avoid getting flats I may actually be able to save enough $$$ to get some <a href="http://www.mec.ca/Products/product_detail.jsp?FOLDER%3C%3Efolder_id=668631&PRODUCT%3C%3Eprd_id=12699&bmUID=1070044183575">cycling pants</a> or even fancy <a href="http://www.mec.ca/Products/product_detail.jsp?FOLDER%3C%3Efolder_id=675583&PRODUCT%3C%3Eprd_id=17161&bmUID=1070044398480">3ply  GoreTex pants</a>.   

I think I've gotten Ryan's Christmas present or birthday present collected.  I'm not sure which it will be - I haven't decided yet.  Ryan, when are you going home for Christmas?

Oh, and I need to build a fancy bright headlight for my bike using <a href="http://lumileds.com/luxeon/products/products_index.html">these Luxeon Emitter</a> super-bright LEDs.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Looks like I'm not alone with having my valve stem shear off in cold weather.  I found <a href="http://users.rcn.com/icebike/Equipment/tires.htm">this IceBiking site</a> via <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=valve+stem+separate+baby+powder&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8">this google search</a> (search the first page for "valve stem").

The thing is I was having this happen BEFORE it got cold but that must have been because my front tire is 8 years old and doesn't stick to the rim very well.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Sometimes when you just seem to have made your mind up about something isn't it "wonderful" when circumstances immediately change and prove you wrong?

One of my co-workers volunteered to spend Christmas in Korea helping support our manufacturing efforts.  He will be there for almost the entire month of December, returning home shortly after the start of the new year.  I took confidence in this that, as he would be there, no one else would need to go.  I came to that conclusion on Monday or Tuesday.  Yesterday the situation changed.

To minimize potential problems one person from basically each discipline will be heading to Seoul to support manufacturing (and fight fires as they happen).  I figured my name was on a list somewhere but took "Joe's" commitment to going as giving me a bye for this session.  I was wrong.  Yesterday I was asked and commited to going to Korea for two weeks starting Monday.  It will be an interesting time I'm sure.  

One concession I have about going to Korea, and not stay here with my family during this pre-Christmas bustle, is that one of my good University of Calgary friends lives in Seoul.  Eric and I graduated together with Computer Engineering degrees and he decided to move back to Korea in September.  I was afraid that I would not be able to make contact with him before the trip, but yesterday we exchanged emails and I hope that we will be able to get together while I am, for perhaps once in my life, in his neighbourhood.

I have lots to do to prepare for my trip, but most of all I wish I had an extra $3000 CDN laying around so I could increase the comfort of my trip by using one of <a href="http://store.apple.com/1-800-MY-APPLE/WebObjects/canadastore.woa/72208/wo/FR1hsk19OGHv3uRpxqKF36nVfL0/0.0.7.1.0.5.21.1.1.1.1.0.0.1.0">these</a> 15 inch aluminum slabs during the long flight.

Five hour battery life stinks.

Anyone have a spare digital camera I could borrow?]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[So, somehow there is a way for me to remotely upload photos that can then appear in my blog entries.  I'm not sure how to do it right now but I would like to experiment and figure it out before I find myself in <a href="http://english.metro.seoul.kr/">Seoul</a>.

So here's a pretty picture to demonstrate the MovableType image upload capabilities.
<a href="http://www.skipandmadge.com/blogimages/haiku.jpg"><img alt="haiku.jpg" src="http://www.skipandmadge.com/blogimages/haiku-thumb.jpg" width="267" height="200" border="0" /></a>

Now I just have to remember how, using CSS, I can have the text nicely wrap the image...  I know how, just not off the top of my head.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Flew into Seoul today.  My <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipod/">iPod</a> Sony MDR-v700DJ<a href="http://www.sonystyle.com/is-bin/INTERSHOP.enfinity/eCS/Store/en/-/USD/SY_DisplayProductInformation-Start;sid=yM9LUf7yiiRLfsEkvrJBWrHjjplQ0ue6zS4=?ProductSKU=MDRV700DJ"> headphones</a> and Tom Clancy book made the flight go quickly enough.  11.5 hours is pretty long of a flight anyway - I don't know if there's really any way to make it go FAST.  The best part of the flight is that the entire middle section of the Boeing-767 seats was empty.  3 of us grabbed entire 3 seat rows to ourselves.  I didn't sleep much but it sure was nice to spread out things and use lots of pillows to get comfy as I read.

Unfortunately the first chapter of the book, that I read on the way to Vancouver, involved an airline hijacking.  Great set of thoughts to get into your head as you are about to fly halfway around the world.

There is a slight touch of snow on the ground - the temperature is just below freezing - but the bus ride from the airport to the hotel was awful because it was so HOT in the bus.

Our hotel is very nice - about 1 mile (a visual guess) from the Olympic Stadium.  I have a night time picture of the olympic rings that I'll put on here.  We arrived at about midnight home time and then went down under the hotel to the mall to find something to eat.  And that's where we found the <a href="http://www.korea.net/koreanculture/imagesofkorean/image_02.asp">Bulgogi</a>.  I should have taken Ryan's camera with me to take a picture of the food.  It looked great and actually tasted pretty good.  Kimchi and salted squid for an appetizer followed by the Bulgogi served in a piping hot cast-iron bowl.  It was yummy and spicy and hot enough to burn my tongue.  Pretty good for 6,000 Won.

After dinner it was back to the hotel.  I was falling asleep in the elevator.  Naturally I woke up a couple of times during the night not knowing where I was.    And I had just settled back to a deep sleep when my 6:45am wake-up call occurred.

At least the hotel room has a nice bathroom (I took pictures).  The shower is wonderful!]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[The trip to Korea is just about over and well, I've been swamped most of the time.  I had planned to write an update every day, but since Monday we have been busy almost every waking hour. Things are going well and as I leave tomorrow I hope that I have sufficiently instructed the workers here on how to debug and repair faulty product.

I also wanted to post pictures that I took - and hoped even to take pictures regularly, but this certainly hasn't been a vacation.  This laptop has also hindered my attempts, as before posting an image it is necessary to clean it up and resize it, because any photo editing software runs slowly on it and, well, its just too much of a headache to try and do it when you're so short on time.

Last night I wanted to do some data analysis to work on a solving a common failure.  Remembering the effectiveness of <a href="http://systems.cs.uchicago.edu/ply/">lex</a> to parse through a text file using regular expressions and create tokens of different type and value, I decided to manipulate some <a href="http://www.python.org">python</a> code from my compiler construction university course of last year.  Within four hours I had a complete program that would read and parse a folder full of text files (one file per product tested) and output a file containing a list of specific test results for each modem.  This tab-deliminated file could then be easily imported into excel for analysis.  (But I don't have Excel installed on this machine because I can't spare the drive space...)

The processing engine is quite fast - but as each record is loaded into memory before the results are output, I think that I am running into a memory limit as the program would lock up the machine while loading the 75th record.  (Each record is about 500 lines long, 7 entries per line.)  I need to add features to it now so that it can pull up any set of tests from the group of tested products.  Lexing the data has allowed me to keep each test (its limits and results) together in an "object" so printing the data from arbitrary objects should be quite simple to do.  (Right now the output is hardcoded for the tests of interest).

Ideally we should load the data into a database that is built to accept queries - perhaps my tool will act similarly - but this should at least get us going.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I've been working on a software project (its been idle for 2.5 months now) that would be nice to use with CVS.  My friend <a href="http://www.susurrous.net/blog/matt">Matt</a> wrote up some basic instructions that I tried to use and almost got to work, but some Mac OS X project bundles (folders that behave like files) didn't seem to agree with CVS and I ran out of enthusiasm trying to make it work.  I reverted to daily backups to my iPod.  

I just ran into <a href="http://developer.apple.com/internet/macosx/cvsoverview.html">this article</a> at <a href="http://developer.apple.com">developer.apple.com</a> that may be able to help me sort it out and get it working.  I had yet to find a proper guide to setting up a personal CVS server and checking personal projects in and out.

<a href="http://www.macosxhints.com/index.php">MacOSXHints.com</a> is usually a good place for this stuff but <a href="http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20031212134909398">this post</a> didn't show up until now.  The hints relating to Xcode are particularly relevant to me.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[So I've been running this site on my desktop mac for several years now (since OS X Public Beta I believe).  This is by far the most sophisticated it has been, and to many web developers, its still very amature.

I find, however, that too many web-development sites cater to themselves and not to the "common man."  They explain how to enhance your sites but assume you already employ the common features.  That's why the CSS-pure weblogging movement began with unemployed web developers.  I think that, while initially quite complicated, non-static web development is within the reach of the average designer (the Joe who can make fancy and compliant static sites).  They shouldn't have to go to IT school to figure out how to use server-side scripting (cgi, asp, php, etc.).  All they need is a good tutorial that explains the basic process and events and doesn't make assumptions about past experience.

That's the beauty of OS X.  <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/>Mac OS X</a>, in combination will all the other Apple products, allows even the most "common man" to do things that otherwise would remain limited to those "computer geeks" around us.  Things like <a href="http://www.apple.com/idvd/">making DVDs</a> of <a href="http://www.apple.com/imovie/">home movies</a>, keeping thousands of <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/">music songs organized</a> and available on the world's most popular <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipod/">mp3 player</a>, <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/store/">purchasing music</a> online (and not pirating), organizing and cataloging <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphoto/">digital photos</a>, and even publishing movies and photos on a <a href="http://www.mac.com/">homepage</a>.  In fact, Apache, the worlds most popular webserving package, comes installed by default on OS X and can be securely turned on by clicking on a checkbox.  Make the common task simple and intuitive - that's what Apple's good at.  If you want complex to configure capabilities you may find your preferred computing platform <a href="http://www.linux.org/">elsewhere</a>.  

If you're one of <a href="http://slashdot.org">these people</a>, the idea of enhancing your website (personal or professional) with server-side scripting, a database, or other complex to configure features is a no-brainer.  You'll download, configure/make, make install, look up the appropriate man pages and have your site fixed up in as little as 12-48 hours.  But for the common man, "Mac OS X Style" (MOSXS) tutorials are needed.  

The beautiful thing is that the tutorials linked to below exist because of Mac OS X.  Mac users historically expect to be able to get what they want done with a minimum of fuss.  Thus with Mac OS X's growing adoption, the expectation to do things usually only available to the configure/make/make install crowd (without all the fuss) has resulted in marvelous projects such as <a href="http://fink.sourceforge.net/">fink</a> and tutorials that actually tutor (instead of a list of <a href="http://www.gnome.org/start/2.4/notes/rninstallation.html">indecipherable steps</a>). 

Sick of those tutorial-writing geeks acting elitist by writing vague and complex tutorials?  Read these instead:
<a href="http://www.macdevcenter.com/pub/a/mac/collections/webserving.html">http://www.macdevcenter.com/pub/a/mac/collections/webserving.html</a>
<a href="http://developer.apple.com/internet/">http://developer.apple.com/internet/</a>

Fortunately, due to Mac OS X's UNIX roots, these tutorials, while written for OS X, give insight on how do do the same things on a windows, linux or BSD box (Jeremy, this means YOU).

Now I just need to find or write a "Mac OS X Style" (MOSXS) tutorial for the Terminal.  Anyone seen one?]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Bing Bing Bing Bing

After arriving home from my recent trip to San Diego, that was the sound that our car made each time you would accelerate or turn left.  The "Brake" light on the dash, that is usually activated when you depress the emergency brake, would come on and the car would continue to Bing until you slowed down or turned right.  The weather warmed up a bit and the Binging occurred less often but did not cease.  Next I went to Korea for two weeks and when I arrived home it was 4 days before Christmas.  The weather was cold again and the Binging occurred much more frequently.  Still, we were too busy to take the car in to get looked at, and as our home lacks a garage, and it was -20 C, I wasn't keen on determining the problem out of doors.  

At the start of this week, Madge made a call to a local GM dealership and booked us an appointment for the car to get looked at.  I had consulted the 1995 Oldsmobile 88 Owner's Manual and read about the Brake Warning Lamp, and the only instructions included, that were of any relevance, were to have the car serviced.  The reason for choosing CMP?  Well, last August our car had a flat tire and CMP was able to offer us the best price on four new tires.  Unfortunately, the inattentive mechanics at CMP, after installing the new tires, places the hubcaps on incorrectly.  The tire valve stem is to fit into a slot in the hubcap, but none of the 4 hubcaps were situated in this manner.  One or two of the tires had slow leaks but we had opted to have the tires looked at when it was time for our next "free" tire rotation at CMP (before 15,000 km).  So two days ago, Thursday, January 8, 2004, Brenda dropped me off at work and took the car to CMP.  They were to check the slow leaking tire(s), determine why my car key made the Security Lamp come on, look into why the stereo backlight flickered, and tell us why the Brake Lamp was coming on.

Thursday, all they did was fix one tire.  They wanted to charge us for replacing the valve stem, and initially we were billed for this two, but as the tire had been leaking since we left their lot they refunded us the $17.50.  

We only have one car.  We were stranded, carless at Brenda's parent's house, and had Thursday night committments.  We were lucky to have their help.

Friday, for half the day, we heard nothing from CMP.  Brenda called and left a message with the service representative Frank.  Finally we heard from him and Brenda relayed me the details.

Basically, the brakes on the car, according to them, were shot.  It was going to cost $1,200 to fix the car.  WHAT!?!  That's absolutely crazy!!!  Brenda was wise enough to ask for a repair breakdown, which she relayed to me at work.  I priced out some parts, to do the same job, and called Frank back to confirm the problems and their price, and then told him that I could do the work myself and asked when I could pick up the car and how much their efforts thusfar were worth.  I was given a ride to CMP, paid $200 for their work, had to get a refund for the valve stem replacement, drove to <a href="http://www.partsource.ca/">Partsource</a> to get the necessary parts to do the job (plus synthetic oil and a filter for an oil change, and new wiperblades that I'd change while I was at it).  The total for the parts (and oil) came to just over $300 CDN, a far cry from CMP's $1200 pricetag.  Certainly CMP would be charging for their labour, but 3X the parts price for labour?  You've got to be kidding!  (And I purchased the best quality third party parts possible - its not like I was going to do a complete brake job on my car and use the cheapest stuff available.)

So what exactly did CMP say was wrong?

Well, the right rear wheel cylinder (the part that pushes the brake shoes out into the brake drum) had been leaking and the shoes and drum were covered with brake fluid.  The shoes would need to be replaced.  The reason, Frank said, that the Brake Warning Lamp was coming on was because the brake fluid had been leaking out and the fluid level, by the master cylinder, had fallen to a point where the sensor was being tripped and we were being Binged to death (well, annoyance).]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>Why blogging is fun AND useful</h4>
My friend <a href="http://spacemonkeys.ca">Matt</a> did a Fourth Year Electrical Engineering Individual Project for course credit at the <a href="http://enel.ucalgary.ca">U of C</a>, and while I can't explain the entire project I do know that it involved the use of Cubic Splines to mathmatically fit a complex curve.  (Don't worry, the techical gargon ends after the next paragraph.) The complex curve would get divided into segments, and each segment could be "exactly" defined by a cubic function (ie. y = x^3 + 2x^2 - x + 4).  

Well, there's a project I'm working on at work where fitting a spline to a set of data points could be very useful.  I looked up some C code on how to do it several months ago and built a project to test it out.  It seemed to work but I never, until today, had the chance to put it into practice and truly make use of it.  Unfortunately, and this is why blogging is USEFUL, I didn't write about my experience, and link to the wonderful pages I discovered (I believe I even found a book excerpt that gave me the code AND explained the nuances of it), and now I can't remember where I found all the info, or where I saved it, and don't want to go sleuth for it again.  I hate having to repeat myself again. (heh)

I wish I could go to my own webpage, type "spline" into the search box, and have a listing of the links that were useful and a mild explanation.  Bookmarks in a web browser <strong>should</strong> help in this situation, and luckily I use <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/">Safari</a> and my bookmarks sync via <a href="http://www.mac.com">.Mac</a> across multiple machines, but in all reality, bookmarks are <strong>context sensitive</strong>.  Sure you can organize them in folders (and subfolders), but really, to make the best use of them, you need to be able to link a bookmark (link a link?) to specific words/actions/situations.  

For example, in my bookmarks menu, I have a subfolder full of electronics links.  No, not links to consumer electronics, but links to pages showing how to do "stuff" with electrical components - how to design Infrared (IR) Remotes for example.  However, when 6 months go by, and I've added a bunch of links to other "goo" like stepper motor drivers, I <strong>hate</strong> having to go through a bunch of links with goofy names trying to remember why I bookmarked it and "<i>Where on Earth I put the link to such and such?</i>" (and on what computer)!

Perhaps I'm giving away a "revolutionary idea" about how computers and people interact and how a piece of software could fill that void, but I don't think so.  It a big shift from typical bookmarks and Word documents as ways of storing information.  That's why I like a database driven blog, because you have an easy search interface that is globally accessible (any computer anywhere).  Its not a perfect solution, but perhaps one day the mechanism for blogging will improve to the point where it is basically a "word processor" that handles images/video/links etc. but isn't proprietary and doesn't cost money to use/own/access.  

That and a new <a href="http://www.apple.com/powerbook/index15.html">15" PowerBook</a>.  

That's ALL I want.  

Ever.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[One of the few features that Windows XP had that Mac OS X didn't have (other than "features" only interesting to virus/trojan/worm writers), before <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">Panther</a> was <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/fastuserswitching/">Fast User Switching</a>.  This feature allows more than one person to be logged into a computer at a time and allows the first user's applications to remain open while the second (or third...) user logs in and uses the machine as though she is the only one logged in.  (See the above link for the marketing-style explanation.)

Well, as the above links show, Panther changes that.  It nice but for my own setup, Madge and I just leave my machine logged in as me and she has her own folder for all her stuff.  It hasn't been a problem and evidently my preferences for dock location (left) and background picture (and whatnot) don't bother her.

I have associates, however, who like Fast User Switching (FUS) but wish for a compromise between full FUS and the single login approach that Madge and I use.   These people like being able to have separate logins and the ability to switch between them quickly and easily, but also wish to use the same iTunes and iPhoto libraries of music and pictures respectively.  You share the same tastes in music and are in the same pictures, right?  iCal could probably fall into this same category, and probably even AddressBook.

Three days ago I decided that it might be worthwhile writting an <a href="http://www.apple.com/applescript">Applescript</a> application that would quickly and easily make the changes necessary to share iApp libraries (databases) between users.
Today at <a href="http://www.macosxhints.com">MacOSXHints.com</a> someone posted a <a href="http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20040121141419759">method to share an iPhoto library</a>. One of the comments even has a script for sharing an iTunes library.  Unfortunately for the average "Joe," shell scripts (if you don't know what one is, don't worry about it) aren't like double clicking a program.  So I've started poking into taking my idea and making it a reality.  I'm using Applescript (and not a shell script) to do it because it offers great interoperability between native Graphical User Interface (GUI) apps and the lower system that shell scripts rely on.  Thus I should be able to make some rather complicated system modifications in a manner that should be seamless to the end user.

As I'll naturally use the MacOSXHints exactly for what they are, I'm not too concerned about trying to make money with a product to do this because:

<ol><li>Though this isn't an "Open Source" project I'll be referencing others' work. <br />(I could think it through on my own, but why reinvent the mechanics of a wheel when you're just making it look nicer?)</li><li>If its truly a useful feature, Apple will just incorporate it into the Operating System anyway.  (See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_(software)">Sherlock</a> vs <a href="http://www.arstechnica.com/reviews/02q3/macosx-10.2/macosx-10.2-13.html">Watson</a>).</li></ol>

Lets see if I actually come through and finish it now...]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[While looking for interesting MovableType plugins I discovered <a href="http://kung-foo.tv">kung-foo.tv</a> (this is probably where I first saw both the BlogTimes plugin in use as well as the "Last 10 Google Referrers" script).  I noticed that the webblog author was working on a piece of software called Kung-Log.  Well, Kung-Log has since been renamed "<a href="http://www.kung-foo.tv/ecto/">ecto</a>."  After hearing many good things about Kung-Log/ecto I decided yesterday to try it out here at work.  Unfortunately, ecto could not get the list of "Entries and Drafts" from the MovableType webblog I'm using here at work.  This is troublesome because I'm looking into finding a way to make it easy for non-html people to use the same webblog at work (using the webblog for a type of error tracking and information collecting).

ecto was giving me error -65795 in a report that looked something like this:

<div class="code">Query:
{blogid = 4; password = ********; username = "********"; }
Response:
{
 "/FaultCode" = -65794; 
 "/FaultExtra" = {domain = -1; error = -65795; msg = "Encountered string encoding error"; }; 
 "/FaultString" = "/CFStreamFault"; 
 "/kWSHTTPResponseMessage" = &lt;NSCFType: 0x154b470&gt;; 
 "/kWSResultIsFault" = 1; 
}</div>

I googled for it and came up with nothing.  I decided to search for the error code on the in the MovableType User Forums and came up with <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/support/index.php?act=ST&#38;f=10&#38;t=15682&#38;hl=65794&#38;s=580fdebd3c84935fcdd8a867ab20e019">this thread</a>.  The last post in the thread, by Adriaant, describes the problem.  

This is the explanation in my own words:
Characters in the posts are not properly formatted using the accepted "html" code and these symbols cannot be properly interpreted by the Apple WebServicesCore that ecto uses.  For example, the ampersand symbol (&#38;) must be coded as "&amp;" and not simply as "&#38;".  (This <a href="http://www.kung-foo.tv/blog/archives/000285.php">kung-foo.tv post</a> confirms and further explains the problem.)

In order to get ecto to properly work with my weblog at work, I had to go through every post and look for characters that would seem to need the proper coding.  I found that &rsquo; needed special coding (&rsquo;).  To know the proper "code" to use to make these symbols, I found these two pages:  <a href="http://www.evolt.org/article/comment/17/21234/">Simple Character Entity Chart</a> and <a href="http://www.jovino.com/stuff/entities.html">HTML Character Entities</a>.  This second page can also be useful for anyone doing C/C++ coding as it includes the hex equivalents for the full ASCII / ISO 8859-1 character set.

So if my posts start to contain a bunch of Greek letters(&phi;&omega;&psi;&mu;&xi;), you'll know what pages inspired me.]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[It's funny that you linked to my character entity chart. I must warn you though that it's presently inacurate by representing depricated entities.

I am presently working on a new chart that will be online after May 1. it will feature an extremely robust lookup table with more characters than you would know what to do with.

My suggestion to you is if you use my chart, you should double check the entity by copying the output character and pasting it inside my parser to double-check the entity number. It's presently residing at: <a href="http://www.jovino.com/parse.html">http://www.jovino.com/parse.html</a> -- and is in a perpetual state of beta.

The HEX codes still stand though. ;)

<title>Xcode Tutorial - a request for requests</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[So according to the "last 10 referrers" sidebar a lot of people are looking for an Xcode Tutorial.  I would be more than happy to write an Xcode Tutorial about the things I've learned over the years using Xcode (and ProjectBuilder) to do introductory-level C, C++ and Objective-C coding.

My experience is primarily at the academic level - where most people's coding experience starts.  I imagine that the people finding this site, while looking for an Xcode Tutorial, are at a similar level of experience.  Xcode (and ProjectBuilder before it) is fantastic for University/College level C and C++ coding.  The integration of GDB (in a non-command-line state) is fantanstic for finding coding errors and bugs.  Its saves a ton of time.  At one time I even found a python syntax-highlighting plugin for ProjectBuilder and Xcode reportedly has built-in syntax highlighting for more languages than before (though I don't have a list...).  emacs can still be faster for several operations (like searching, for example) where in Xcode you have to have to raise your hand off the keyboard and use the mouse.  But for building and debugging, Xcode is great.  

So if someone could please list (as a comment to this post) what kind of information they would like to see in an Xcode Tutorial, I'll definitely do what I can to provide a clean, clear and crisp tutorial.]]></content:encoded>

I opened Xcode & started typing out Hello world & am trying to compile it now.  have no idea how to do it.   I created the program by clicking on "new empty file".   do I have to start by creating a project?

even before your full fledged tutorial.. can you tell me real quick how to type - compile - run & debug in just short words??  that would be immensely helpful.

Appreciate it.]]></wp:comment_content>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[So I've spent a considerable amount of time looking into sharing an iPhoto library between multiple users and I've run into some challenges.  I'd discuss the challenges and some potential solutions, but I've run into these two potential solutions:
<a href="http://homepage.mac.com/bwebster/iphotolibrarymanager.html">iPhoto Library Manager</a><br />
<a href="http://www.malcolmadams.com/itunes/itinfo/sharedlib.php">Doug's AppleScripts for iTunes</a><br />
The iPhoto Library Manager claims to work with iPhoto 4 while the Applescripts do not (yet).  Perhaps my efforts are better spent elsewhere.

I'll test these out and let you know.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Madge and I purchased our home (well, started paying back the bank for paying our home for us...) one month before we were married, exactly.  During the first two weeks of our posession I spent most of my time in the empty, stinky-like-the-previous-owners house studying my brains out for my end of term exams.  During this time I had my first experience with what has now become quite a regular occurrance.  

10:30 one morning the doorbell rang.  I was busy studying and was surprised at the sound.  I couldn't believe that someone was at my door, perhaps it was one of my sisters.  Nope.  It was two gentlemen selling vacuums.  I was concerned at the position I was in, as I, like most people, don't particularly enjoy dealing with door-to-door salesmen.  Luckily I had an out.  The first gentleman introduced himself and asked the unforgettable question, "Are your parents home?"  

Shocked and rather stunned at his question, I couldn't bring myself to embarrass him by saying, "I'm not sure, would you like me to call and find out?"  Instead I took the easy way out by playing along with his mis-judgement of my age and merely responded, much as a teenager would, "No."  It was easy and quite amusing.  And for 22, I did look quite young.  Evidently I still do.

<div class="imgright"><a href="http://www.skipandmadge.com/photos/misc_skip/dad_driving_tractor.jpg"><img src="http://www.skipandmadge.com/photos/misc_skip/dad_driving_tractor-tm.jpg" height="200" width="266" border="0" alt="dad_driving_tractor" /></a><br />
Act young, Feel young, Pretend young<br />
</div>
Five years later I still answer the door and hear the now quite hilarious words, "Are your parents home?"  Just last week was my last experience, and Madge broke into laughter as I closed the door.  I hadn't shaved for probably three days and had visible whiskers (no magnifying glass needed).  ...So much for thinking that I <strong>do</strong> look older than 16 or 19.  And I've yet to correct, and embarrass, anyone soliciting at my door.  Even the one time I answered the door while holding my then one year-old daughter in my arms I held a straight face and merely answered, "No."  

Well, we're expecting a second child in the middle of May, and I've been quite quiet about the whole situation.  Perhaps I don't feel comfortable "announcing" it in conversations, or I'm shy and just want to keep it part of my private life.  But I don't think those are the big reasons why I haven't told more than about five people (outside of family).  I think it comes down to my "baby-face" situations at the door of my own home.  

Having grown accustomed to the ackward situation of being considered 16 or 19 years old when I'm really 26 and rapidly approaching 30, I think I shy away from the potential scrutiny, and judgement, by my peers who, not knowing my age, would give me a hard time about having a child (or second child) when I'm "so young."  I'm incredibly happy and excited about having another baby.  I'm confident that we have made the right decision in creating a sibling for Lauryn and I know that we'll be a happy family.  Madge is a wonderful mother and I love being a daddy.  I even have to avoid holding little babies, as I wouldn't want to let it go.  

But I don't want to actually go through the process of embarrassing someone who thinks that I'm "only nineteen," or "only twenty-one," and have made a rash decision (or mistake) in having a baby.  I'm not interested in being placed in a position where I feel I need to defend myself.  This is the right thing for us to do and I don't want to deal with other peoples' mis-interpretation of the situation.

And maybe one day I'll break down and start telling people who ring my doorbell, "No, I don't think they're home.  This is my house, but I could call and find out if they're home if you think its important."]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA["I'm sorry but my parents aren't home" has become part of my regular defense against door nazis.  I had always struggled with how I could avoid the snares of the door-to-door sales person until one day, like skip, one of them asked "are your parents home".  Since that day the simple phrase "my parents aren't home" has repelled even most savvy of door knockers.  

I should mention that I am thirty years old and that line of defense still works with my 7 month old daughter in my arms.]]></wp:comment_content>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[As a child I learned a song about springtime.  It went like this:
<div class="quote">I looked out the window and what did I see?
Popcorn popping on the apricot tree.
Spring has brought me such a nice surprise,
Blossoms popping right before my eyes...
</div>

Shortly after meeting Madge she alerted me to a rather strange talent I seem to have developed - the ability to crossfade between songs while singing them.  Or, in more clear terms, I could sing the first few lines of one song and, without noticing, finish the verse by singing lyrics from a completely different song.  The most memorable example was the mixing of "Popcorn Popping" and "Swing Low, Sweet Chariot," using the lyrics below and to the tune of "Swing Low."
<div class="quote">I looked out the window and what did I see?
Comin' for to carry me home.
Popcorn popping on the apricot tree,
Comin' for to carry me home..
</div>
<div class="imgright">

Excited because its Christmas Eve
</div>
Its been fun to accidentally discover songs whose tunes easily blend and are swappable, but today my daughter Lauryn showed that she has inherited my talent.

<div class="quote">Lauryn's Song<br />
(To the tune of Row Row Row Your Boat)<br />
Feb. 9, 2004<br /><br />
Row row row your boat<br />
Gently down the stream.<br />
Mary Mary quite contrary<br />
How your garden grow?<br />

It has been more than a month since I arrived back from Korea and its time that I put some of my pictures up.  Last night I stitched my "panorama" pictures together and so here they are.  They popup to be large images if you want a closer look.  And yes, you can see the seams between the pictures.  

The first shot is of my first hotel room (I had a second that was slightly larger - it had a couch).  The second shot is a composite of 12 pictures that I took out of my hotel window showing my night-time view.  And the last shot is of Ian, Jared and Owen in front of the Korean War Memorial.]]></content:encoded>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[Our friends <a href="http://www.spacemonkeys.ca/blogs/matt/">Matt</a> and <a href="http://www.spacemonkeys.ca/blogs/tamara/">Tamara</a> recently acquired a new iBook.  I'd link directly to Matt's post "Introducing Chinook," but his permanent links aren't working.  

Anyway, Matt had some questions/points/observations about OS X that I've been meaning to address.  

<h4>Emacs</h4>
Its actually not necessary to use Apple's X11, or Fink,  to run Emacs.   <a href="http://members.shaw.ca/akochoi-emacs/">Andrew Choi</a> has been the OSX/Carbon Emacs maintainer, but has recently resigned.  His <a href="http://members.shaw.ca/akochoi-emacs/">site</a> includes instructions if you wish to build it yourself.  Binaries for Panther and Jaguar can be found at <a href="http://mindlube.com/products/emacs/index.html">mindlube.com</a>, however.  This way you can stick Emacs in the dock as its a fully native version.  Andrew's Carbon changes have been included in the latest Emacs source tree as well, so future versions <em>should</em> continue to be native (if built with the proper options).

<h4>MPI</h4>
I'm unable to go the the MPI link that Matt provides.  I used the MPICH implementation found at <a href="http://hpc.sourceforge.net/">hpc.sourceforge.net</a>.  (LAM MPI is now available as well, as is XMPI.)  HPC is a great resource for binaries and source specific to Panther and Jaguar for High Performance Computing tools including, but not limited to,  Fortran, MPI, OpenMP, Octave, Cactus, and Globus.

<h4>Bookmark Syncing</h4>
Honestly one of the most compelling features of Apple's <a href="http://www.mac.com/">.Mac</a> service is <a href="http://www.mac.com/1/iTour/tour_bookmarks.html">Safari Bookmark</a> and <a href="http://www.mac.com/1/iTour/tour_addressbook.html">Address Book</a> syncing (not synching - pronounced "cinching").  On any machine in the world, I can have access to and modify <strong>all</strong> my bookmarks and contacts.  On OS X machines that I have an account on, the process is seamless.  On a Windows or Linux box all I have to do is open "http://bookmarks.mac.com" and voila!  

However, if your not interested in subscribing to this service (at least try it for free for 60 days...),   you could roll your own system, as Matt proposes to do, using WebDAV.  MacOSXHints has all kinds of webDAV hints, but <a href="http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20021114063433862&#38;query=webdav">here's directions</a> on setting in up on OS X.  The same process my work on other platforms.  The challenge to rolling your own system is building the app/script to place/pull the latest bookmarks file(s) on/off the server AND making a web-viewable/editable representation of the bookmarks (if that's a feature you're interested in).  Could be a fun project though.

<h4>CUPS - common UNIX printing system</h4>
I'm not sure why this isn't documented (or maybe it is) but if you hold down Option while selecting Printer > Add Printer... you have access to a fairly large set of printer connection options.  Matt could probably keep his current CUPS configuration and add the same printer again using the GUI (and the handy Option key) and see if he can arrange a better configuration in this manner.

Oh, and while searching <a href="http://www.macosxhints.com">MacOSXHints</a> for 'default' and 'browser' I discovered this <a href="http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20040101194202284&#38;query=default+browser">Print to a remote CUPS server</a> hint that might help Matt out. (As might <a href="http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20031210081441221">this one</a>.)

<h4>Safari as Default Browser</h4>
As evidenced by my <a href="http://www.skipandmadge.com">main page</a> Firefox web badge, I support Firefox, though I only use it on my Windows machine at work.  I personally would prefer if they branded Firefox as 1.0 instead of 0.8, but really the version number is irrelevant.  People who don't build software themselves always seem wary of sub-1.0 software, but anyway...

I agree with Matt that the place for selecting a default browser in OS X is stupidly located in Safari's preferences.  However, I think I have a reasonable idea of <strong>why</strong> this is so.  

With the conversion of iTools to .Mac, some of the free iTools services preferences, formerly located in the System Preferences > Internet were migrated to System Preferences > .Mac.  However, this left the Default Browser preference all alone.  It didn't belong in the .Mac or Network Panes, and didn't really deserve its own pane.  The only place left, I suppose, is in Safari's preferences.  

Unfortunately, this isn't completely sound reasoning.  Mail, OS X's default email client, also has the "Default Email Reader" preference within its <strong>own</strong> preferences, just like Safari.  This is a rather Microsoft-like tactic it seems.  Perhaps a third party should write an Internet Preferences Pane that gives a proper location for selecting the default browser and email client.  Unfortunately, if you're the type of person who would enjoy this pane, you'd have to install it yourself and would probably know where to change the settings anyway.  BAH, it would only be useful if Apple included it themselves...]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[After reading this <a href="http://books.slashdot.org/books/04/02/19/1910207.shtml">Learning Unix for Mac OS X Panther book review</a> on slashdot.org this afternoon, I noticed some links in the reader comments that addressed at least one of the ideas/concerns I brought up in my earlier <a href="http://www.skipandmadge.com/archives/000017.html">MOSXS - Apache webserving on OS X</a> post.  This book, from the sound of the review, would be a fantastic resource for a few of my friends.  For myself, I'm not certain.  To learn the inner workings of Linux, I was under the tutelage of <a href="http://www.spacemonkeys.ca/blogs/matt/">Matt</a>, <a href="http://members.shaw.ca/laurieandtammy/">Laurie</a> and <a href="http://www.biffard.com/">Ryan</a> and consider myself rather above the level of this book.  If I didn't have such geeky friends, however, it would probably satiate my curiosity about the command line manipulation of Mac OS X.

In my earlier MOSXS post I quested for Mac OS X Terminal Tutorial.  This site seems adequate:
<a href="http://www.xml-dev.com:8080/tldp/http://oliyoung.com/TerminalBasic.xml">Using the Mac OS X Terminal (HTML)</a>  or <a href="http://www.xml-dev.com:8080/tldp_pdf/http://oliyoung.com/TerminalBasic.xml">Using the Mac OS X Terminal (PDF)</a> .  Books are great but free online resources are even better - as long as you remember where it was and <a href="http://www.skipandmadge.com/archives/000020.html">under what title you bookmarked it.</a>  Hopefully this post will allow me to remember where to point my other non-Linux friends when they need to start using the terminal.  Certainly the Learning Unix book above would be a better resource, but its not free.

There was also a link to <a href="http://www.versiontracker.com/dyn/moreinfo/macosx/17621">GeekTool</a> - a Sourceforge project that allow a system log, unix commands, and images to be displayed on the desktop.  You can graph network traffic, keep track of uptime and cpu usage, and pretty much anything else that you commonly "look up" in a terminal.  I haven't used it much, but it looks pretty spiffy and if I have the time to configure it I'm sure I'll dig it.

And as for the power of the terminal, well <a href="http://www.intuitive.com/wicked/">Wicked Cool Shell Scripts</a> is reputed to have a collection of useful or just plane wacky shell scripts (text-based HangMan anyone?) that will run on Mac OS X (or Unix or Linux).  I still have to fully check it out before I can apply my SkipsStampOfApproval&#8482; and fully recommend it.

And for a non-terminal hint, hold down Command (Cmd, the Apple key)  and then click on the titlebar of a non-focus window (a window that isn't the foremost) and drag it around, still leaving it in its non-focus state.  (Is there an equivalent capability in Windows or Linux?)   And for one more, hold down Option and click on a non-focus  window.  The application that was in focus is hidden and the application of the clicked window becomes the active application.  Oh, and if you hold Cmd+Option and click on a non-focus window, <strong>all</strong> the other applications are hidden and only the selected one remains.  Nifty?  It can be quite a timesaver if you remember the combinations and they become habit.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I've had lots to say lately, but haven't had time to write it.  <a href="http://www.kung-foo.tv/ecto/">Ecto</a>, the software that I use instead a web interface to post to this weblog, has come along to the point where I purchased a license today.  The feature that moved me from demo user to registered was ecto's integration with iPhoto, making it relatively seamless to post pictures.  <div class="imgright"><img src="http://www.skipandmadge.com/photos/misc_skip/img_8624_edit.jpg" height="177" width="266" alt="lilo_at_rick_s_wedding" title="lilo_at_rick_s_wedding" /><br />Lilo at Uncle Rick's Wedding</div>I hope that the developer adds the ability to modify the templates, and I'm also anxious to try out a version for Windows.  They say they're working on it, but I'm sure it will take time.

I also ran into <a href="http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20040224063353596">this posting</a> at <a href="http://www.macosxhints.com/">MacOSXHints.com</a> about syncing Safari (and other browser) bookmarks with a provided PERL script.  This seems to be just the feature that <a href="http://www.spacemonkeys.ca/matt/">Matt</a> was interested in, but I don't know if it is designed to sync bookmarks for browsers on remote machines or only on the local machine.

And the biggest occupier of brain power recently, as been the contemplation of following my employer's offer to move and work in San Diego for a year.  The troublesome part is that we're going to be having a new baby in the middle of May, and my employer wants me to be working in <a href="http://www.sannet.gov/">San Diego</a> full time in the middle of May.  An exciting offer but there's lots of details to work out.

You may also notice that I recently added some code to the <a href="http://www.skipandmadge.com">main page</a> template to include the 20-minute delayed stock prices of the two Nasdaq stocks I'm most interested in.  The code to retrieve the appropriate stock graph image from yahoo is nothing more than

<div class="code">&#60;img border="0" src="http://ichart.yahoo.com/t?s=nvtl"&#62;&#60;br /&#62;<br />&#60;img border="0" src="http://ichart.yahoo.com/t?s=aapl"&#62;</div>

But in the process of trying to find a graph this size that also showed the volume throughout the day, I discovered some other graphs but never was I able to find a complete listing off all the graphs and all the options for each type of graph.  But I did learn that

<div class="code"><a href="http://ichart.yahoo.com/t?s=nvtl">http://ichart.yahoo.com/t?s=nvtl</a> <br />gives the the nice small graph where s=[the stock symbol of interest; nvtl, aapl]<br />
<a href="http://ichart.yahoo.com/b?s=nvtl">http://ichart.yahoo.com/b?s=nvtl</a><br />daily large<br />
<a href="http://ichart.yahoo.com/h?s=nvtl">http://ichart.yahoo.com/h?s=nvtl</a><br />teeny tiny<br />
<a href="http://ichart.yahoo.com/w?s=nvtl">http://ichart.yahoo.com/w?s=nvtl</a> <br />shows the last five days in a large format<br />
<a href="http://ichart.yahoo.com/v?s=nvtl">http://ichart.yahoo.com/v?s=nvtl</a><br /> shows the last five days in a small format<br />
<a href="http://ichart.yahoo.com/z?s=nvtl">http://ichart.yahoo.com/z?s=nvtl</a><br /> give a larger graph and allows for options like  <br />
&#38;t=[length of time; 1d, 5d, 1m, 1y, 5y]<br />
&#38;q=[bar, line, or cdl graph; l, b, ???]<br />
&#38;l=[logarithmic graph; on, off]<br />
&z=[size; s, m, l]<br />
&#38;c=[compare with other symbol; aapl, nvtl]<br />
&#38;a=[volume;v]<br />
</div>
Some of these options are available to some of the other graphs as well but I haven't figured out which options apply to which graphs.  
For example:
<div class="code"><a href="http://ichart.yahoo.com/z?s=AAPL&#38;t=5d&#38;l=on&#38;z=m&#38;q=l&#38;c=nvtl&#38;a=v">http://ichart.yahoo.com/z?s=AAPL&#38;t=5d&#38;l=on&#38;z=m&#38;q=l&#38;c=nvtl</a></div>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Somewhere around May 20, 2004, Madge and I will be having a new baby.  We don't know if it will be a boy or a girl and I certainly hope its not more than 5 days early since I arrive home from San Diego May 13, 2004.

Tonight we had a few minutes where we could actually sit down and think about baby names.  We pulled out our file from <a href="http://www.skipandmadge.com/baby/">last time</a>, and started looking over the list of names that we <strong>didn't</strong> use.

<strong>NO</strong> I'm <strong>NOT</strong> going to tell you what we've picked (as I can't because we haven't &#8211; and I wouldn't anyway).  However I did find a mighty fine list of "<strong>10 Baby Naming Hints</strong>."  And here they are:

<div class="quote">
<h4>10 Baby Naming Hints</h4>
<ol><li>The name must be comfortable right away for you.  Will you sound funny yelling it across the playground?
Eg."Dionysius!!" </li><li>The number of syllables in the first name should be different from the number of syllables in the last name.  The combination of names shouldn't <em>say</em> anything.  
Eg.  Scott Land</li><li>The first and last or all three names' initials shouldn't spell anything bad. 
Eg.  Harold Oliver Goldman = HOG</li><li>If the spelling or pronunciation is too unusual, the child will have to continually correct it.</li><li>Use a name from a family member, famous person, and/or combination of family or ethnic names.</li><li>Combine names to create a new baby name.</li><li>Be conscious of nicknames and variations.</li><li>Practice the baby's name to see how it feels.  You'll use it a lot.</li><li>Use the middle name to honour a family member, give two middle names or leave it blank for the child to choose when they're 18.</li><li>Avoid first and last names with the same letter.  First name should not end with a letter or syllable that the last name begins with.</li></ol></div>

I don't really think we'll leave our child's middle name blank expressly so that he/she can change it to "<a href="http://www.aardman.com/wallaceandgromit/home.asp">Gromit</a>" when s/he's 18, but other than that, the list seems reasonable. 

Here's another interesting statement about how to "<a href="http://ar.essortment.com/babygirlname_rerb.htm">Avoid giving your baby girl a trendy name</a>."]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I've been using <a href="http://www.kung-foo.tv/blog/archives/000330.php">googlog</a> to provide a sidebar listing of the last 10 recent searches that have lead people to my site.  It has worked quite well until I started getting a lot of <a href="http://www.spywareinfo.com/articles/referer_spam/">referrer spam</a>.  As googlog only keeps a local listing of the last 50 referrers, the spammers quite quickly overrun the legit searches and googlog is useless.

But here's how to fight back (well, defend yourself).
I can click on the <a href="http://www.skipandmadge.com/referrers/show-refs.php">link to the local listing of referrers</a> and see the listing of the last 50 referrers.  Following these <a href="http://www.wannabegirl.org/archives/007196.php">Blocking Referrer Spam</a> directions, I learned that you can simply place a the following code inside a <span style="font-size:11px/12px; font-family:'Courier', 'Monaco', monospace;">.htaccess</span> file  inside the main directory from where my pages are served.

<div class="code">SetEnvIfNoCase Referer ".*(casino|gambling|poker|porn|sex).*" BadReferrer<br />
order deny,allow<br />
deny from env=BadReferrer</div>

Unfortunately I had two problems as I tried to do this.  First, I had to tell Apache to look for and use the <span style="font-size:11px/12px; font-family:'Courier', 'Monaco', monospace;">.htaccess</span> file.  <a href="http://www.macdevcenter.com/pub/a/mac/2002/01/29/apache_macosx_four.html?page=last&#38;offset=101">MacDevCenter</a> to the rescue!

I needed to change the <span style="font-size:11px/12px; font-family:'Courier', 'Monaco', monospace;">AllowOverride</span> line that started as:
<div class="code">   # This controls which options the .htaccess files
    # in directories can override. Can also be "All",
    # or any combination of "Options", "FileInfo", 
    # "AuthConfig", and "Limit".

    AllowOverride None
</div>
to be
<div class="code">    AllowOverride All
</div>
Next I needed to restart Apache using <span style="font-size:11px/12px; font-family:'Courier', 'Monaco', monospace;">sudo apachectl graceful restart</span>.

The second problem I had was that I placed a new line character (carriage return) between <span style="font-size:11px/12px; font-family:'Courier', 'Monaco', monospace;">SetEnvIfNoCase Referer</span> and <span style="font-size:11px/12px; font-family:'Courier', 'Monaco', monospace;">".*(casino|gambling|poker|porn|sex).*" BadReferrer</span>

This made my <span style="font-size:11px/12px; font-family:'Courier', 'Monaco', monospace;">.htaccess</span> file invalid and caused Apache to only show my error page.

If I find I'm still getting referrer spam, then all I need to do is add the names of the spamming sites to the listing of <span style="font-size:11px/12px; font-family:'Courier', 'Monaco', monospace;">(casino|gambling|<strong>newspammerdomain</strong>|<strong>newwordinthespamdomains</strong>)</span>.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>All Home-pages Should be Weblogs</h4>

This site, as noted in the main page's sidebar, is powered by <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/">MovableType</a>.  MovableType (not Mov<strong>e</strong>ableType) is basically a piece of software that runs on the web server that stores page content in a database and generates static html pages from that content.  This means that I don't have to write any of my pages in HTML by hand.  I don't have to worry about broken links and keeping the main (index) page updated with only the most recent posts.  MovableType does all the work.  

In fact, I can modify the templates for the site (the templates govern the basic layout of each of the pages) and regenerate every page with the click of a button.  It also allows me to upload files (usually pictures) to my website and makes it easy for me to include them in any posts I may make.  MoveableType's main interface is also nothing more than a web page.  This means that I can log into my web server, via a web page, from any computer in the world, and post and make changes to my site.  

I firmly believe that people only do that which is easy/fun or absolutely necessary.  If it takes too much effort, chances are you'll get tired of it and never do it again.  I believe that this is what happens to most people's web pages.  They think its cool to have a website, they make an initial web page or two by hand (and spend hours and hours doing it) and then never add another page because it simply isn't easy enough.  We have other important things to do in our lives, and if it takes a couple of hours every time you want to write about or show something on a website, the initial discovery-fun of HTML gets old and you just won't go through the hassle anymore.  

ISPs (Internet Service Providers) should <strong>STOP</strong> merely giving 5 MB of web space for every connection and should <strong>ALL</strong> include server-side web-log software (like MovableType) so that anyone can easily post to their own web-space without having to learn HTML.  This would also make it <strong>more challenging</strong> for people to write web pages that aren't <a href="http://validator.w3.org/">valid HTML</a>. 

[Aside: The fact that <strong>most</strong> web pages are not actually compliant to the HTML specifications makes the job of writing web browsers (like <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/">Safari</a>, <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/">FireFox</a>, <a href="http://channels.netscape.com/ns/browsers/browsing.jsp">Netscape</a>, and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/default.asp">Internet Explorer</a>) incredibly challenging, not to mention the impossible task of trying to write a web page that IS compliant, that looks the same in every major browser.  Browser developers spend most of their time trying to make invalid code look correctly and then don't have the time to implement new segments of the HTML/CSS (and other) standards.]

Unfortunately, I can't influence ISPs and I can't teach everyone how to write valid HTML, but I can share helpful information with those of people who are trying to do this on their own.  Today I decided that it would be worthwhile to learn how to backup and restore the database that contains all my posts.  If this database were to disappear, I would lose this entire site (except for the static pages that you're reading right now).  I have chosen to store my content in a <a href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySql</a> database.  MovableType will work with a flat-file <a href="http://www.sleepycat.com/">BerkelyDB</a> and <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSql</a> databases (and maybe others), but I wanted to learn more about MySql and now I'm committed.  

If the MySql database that I was using to store the content for this website was called <span style="font-size:11px/12px; font-family:'Courier', 'Monaco', monospace;">movabletype_database</span>, and the MySql "user" that accessed the database was <span style="font-size:11px/12px; font-family:'Courier', 'Monaco', monospace;">mysql_user</span>, then the command to save the <span style="font-size:11px/12px; font-family:'Courier', 'Monaco', monospace;">movabletype_database</span> database to the file <span style="font-size:11px/12px; font-family:'Courier', 'Monaco', monospace;">movabletype_database_backup_todays_date.sql</span> (using the a command-line terminal) would be:

<div class="code">mysqldump -u mysql_user -p --opt movabletype_database &gt; movabletype_database_backup_todays_date.sql</div>

I would then be prompted to enter the password for mysql_user and that's it.  If I then want to restore this backup, the command that I need to enter is:

<div class="code">mysql -u msql_user -p movabletype_database &lt; movabletype_database_backup_todays_date.sql</div>

Now I should be able to script the daily backup of the database so I could never lose more than perhaps one day's posts.  (Oh, and half of the reason why I wrote these instructions down is so that I can remember how to do it the next time I need to do a backup.  This blog may simply become a <a href="http://www.skipandmadge.com/archives/000020.html">context sensitive bookmark mechanism</a> one day.)]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I've spent the last 7 days here in San Diego, California, and apart from the rather constant pleasant weather there's one thing that I quite like about this place.  

<strong>No Streetlights</strong>
"What?!?" you may say, "Doesn't that make it less safe?" or, "Doesn't that make it hard to see at night?"   To the contrary.  Let me explain.

I grew up in a small town in the middle of the flat prairie.  To the West were the mountains.  To the East was the flat horizon.  No one looked East, as anything of importance <strong>always</strong> came from the West.  The wind prevailed from the West, and with it came the clouds and the weather.  No native trees exist on the prairie, neither do hills, so it was always possible to look West and accurately forecast the weather.  At night the stars would shimmer and beckon like a sea of pearls floating on deep waters.  The impact of the few town streetlights was negligible on the night sky's visibility.  It was easy to practice <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=define:astronomy&#38;ie=UTF-8&#38;oe=UTF-8">astronomy</a> as the sky's jewelry was always on display.  My favorites were the <a href="http://comets.amsmeteors.org/meteors/showers/perseids.html">Perseids</a> in August and Orion, Taurus, and the <a href="http://www.ras.ucalgary.ca/~gibson/pleiades/">Pleiades</a>.

And then I moved to the city.  The glow of Calgary can been seen in the night sky from more than 150 km away (when there's cirrus cloud cover).  Within the city there's so much <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=define:+light+pollution&#38;ie=UTF-8&#38;oe=UTF-8">light pollution</a> that usually the Moon alone is visible.  

For the first year or so I was too occupied with my new life of the city to notice how much I longed to simply see the stars.  Over time I missed their brilliance more and more.  Even climbing to the top of <a href="http://content.calgary.ca/CCA/City+Hall/Business+Units/Parks/Parks+and+Locations/Natural+Environment+Parks/Locations/Natural+Areas+in+NW+Calgary/Nose+Hill+Park.htm">Nose Hill</a> <a href="http://www.ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/calgary/nosehill.html">Park</a> did not sufficiently shield me from the blinding, omnipresent glow.

And then I arrived in the bustling, sprawling city of San Diego.  And even in what are busy parts of town (non-downtown I'll admit), after the sun sets the stars unveil themselves.  It is <strong>fantastic</strong>.  Driving around the city at night, it is impossible to guess how densely populated the area is, because of the curious lack of illumination.  You'd never accurately guess the number of houses/condos/roads exist, because they simply aren't visible.  Only intersections seem to have streetlights, and the difference (in having so few) is amazing.  Driving through residential areas of town at night is like driving through the countryside.

And the stars are everywhere!  Its certainly better on the beach, but deep in the city the recent <a href="http://www.sunspot.noao.edu/sunspot/pr/glossary.html#conjunction">conjunction</a> of the Moon and Venus stood out in the night time sky.  (Well, it wasn't a true conjunction and Venus <strong>is</strong> the brightest "star" in the night sky, but you get my point).

And what of safety?  Well, Northern San Diego feels pretty safe.  Its very quiet and the weather is too pleasant for people to have a reason to cause trouble (I sound pretty naive, right?).  However, when its dark and you're walking down the street and no streetlights exist overhead, your eyes adjust and its possible to actually see quite far.  With streetlights, the direct area is lit, but the shadows are dark and very concealing.  

And then there's the environment.  Think of all the energy wasted into the night sky.  For what purpose?  In winter, its too cold and unpleasant for people to be out after dark.  And how much do streetlights help motorists?  Cars have headlights.  In fact, I'm quite bothered each time I drive out of South Airdrie onto the #2 highway (if you know the area) because the transition from <strong>many</strong> street lights to <strong>none</strong> occurs as you get onto the on ramp.  Thus as you try to merge with the busy highway traffic, your eyes have not adjusted to the light disparity and I always feel quite blind and in a hazardous position.  More streetlights would improve that situation, but so would fewer streetlights earlier on.

I suppose that the raised reflectors in California, that help drivers see the lanes and edges of the road, wouldn't survive one swipe of the winter snowplows and would never be visible from under the snow.  But, perhaps your headlights would actually help you see better if there were no other major sources of light.  It would be like driving down a country road at night instead of this perpetual street-level twilight.

Aah, but its nice to see the stars.  And its nice to not waste energy needlessly and send it into the sky for other worlds to see.  

If you happen to have a good view of the stars, these <a href="http://skymaps.com/">sky maps (star charts)</a> have become quite handy and fun while I've been down here.  So has this <a href="http://www.mystarslive.com/">interactive star chart</a> (map) from <a href="http://www.mystarslive.com/">mystarslive.com</a>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>Beware of SSSS</h4>
I very recently returned from a trip to San Diego, California.  Instead of returning directly to Calgary (via Denver) I needed to spend a day working in <a href="http://maps.yahoo.com/maps_result?zoomin=yes&#38;name=&#38;ed=ffAwBOp_0Tr2y18din0daIC0JvPdkw_CHoQqkGhOBjllBAy_3mOzOCXT4I9oHM6mrne811K7vMNhPnwN_.U0RKuIk7iHxAp.E2Xz_FM-&#38;state=CA&#38;csz=Pleasanton%2C+CA+94588-2713&#38;ds=n&#38;uzip=94588&#38;mag=5&#38;desc=&#38;country=US&#38;dma=807&#38;cat=comm&#38;resize=s&#38;rezoom=0&#38;.intl=us&#38;compass=&#38;pan_x=0&#38;pan_y=0">Pleasanton, California</a> before returning home.  I had about 3 hours notice before I was to leave and was lucky to have the assistance of a good travel agent at <a href="http://www.vision2000alberta.ca/">Vision 2000</a> who quickly modified my itinerary and had me booked to fly out that evening to Oakland.  

However, I have a feeling that last minute flight bookings immediately put you on some sort of "Security Hit-list," as for both my flight to Oakland, and the flight the next evening to Seattle &#38; Calgary, an interesting "SSSS" was printed on the bottom edge of both halves of my boarding pass.

For both flights, as soon as the Security agent saw my boarding pass (and its SSSSs), the agent looked up and say, "Can you follow me please?"  I would be escorted to the front of the security gate line where I would have to do the regular empty-the-pockets, pull-out-the-laptop, and walk through the gate routine.  Afterward I would have to go back to a special area and take a seat.  An agent would go through my bags, shoes and pocket contents, while another would have me lift my feet (while seated) and "swipe" them with a metal detector.  A more thorough swipe and pat-down would then occur while I stood on a mat with brown foot outlines.  

The second time this occurred, I think I surprised the agent by raising my foot and arms before being asked.  He asked if I had done this before and I told him that I'd had the same experience yesterday.  Luckily, for both flights, I arrived sufficiently early and hence wasn't stressed by the security delay.  

At least this set of flights didn't involve passing through a security checkpoint overcome with the smell of stinky feet.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[The plan was simple.  One year in San Diego would require only a small number of housewares and one 5'x8' Uhaul trailer would fit everything.  Our "Grey Grandma" car is sufficently "grandma" to tow a trailer and the drive from Calgary, Alberta, Canada to San Diego, California, USA would only take two or three days.  The economical savings would be substantial and a road trip with my brother Isopraxis would be fun.  He's done most of the trip many a time and knows a lot of the back roads that would keep us away from the congestion of I-15.  

So we head off South and arrive at the Coutts/Sweetgrass border crossing.  Madge had done a lot of legwork to ensure that I would have no trouble importing our car into the States.  As I have American citizenship, I have no problem traveling across the border, but my US manufactured Canadian car is a different story.  The car has a VIN that begins with the number "1".  This means that it was manufactured in the United States but is marked and sold as a Canadian car.  

I've thought of several titles for this entry revolving around the troubles we had at the border, but the significance of "Power in Gas and Gas in Power" will be explained near the end of the post. 

We were planning on importing the car as a Non-Resident for the period of one year.  This situation would mean that we wouldn't need to have the normally-required letter from the manufacturer stating that the car complies to DOT safety standards.  Well, regardless of where I plan on living for the rest of my life and where I own a house, because I'm an American citizen, there is no compulsion for me to leave and take my car back to Canada.  So despite the assurance that Brenda had received earlier that this was a proper method for me, as an American, to temporarily import a vehicle, the customs, oops, I mean "homeland security" officers would not, despite talking to two supervisors and multiple collect calls to Madge, let me continue the trip with my potentially non-compliant car.  The second supervisor quite brusquely shot down any argument that I made and ended our conversation by saying that, "We treat everyone this way.  That's just the way it is."

It personally sounds like power-hungry incompetents flexing their intimidation muscles as much as possible.  We had the verbal assurance from one of the heads of the homeland security and customs office (in DC) that what we were trying to do was completely legitimate and that if the officers at the borders had any problems or questions they could call him directly.   Hence one of the potential titles was, "Don't Cross the Border on Friday at 4:30 PM," or something to that effect.  Despite showing the officer the name and phone number of the official who was to assist me, he, "Didn't have any idea who this person is and why what he would have to say would be any different from his supervisor."  And no one would even try to call the official because it was Friday afternoon and no one in DC would be in the office at 6:30.  

Much to my chagrin, and to my luck, I was able to finally legitimately import the car at 8:30 that same night.  The first time I talked to one of the officers, I was given the name and phone number of someone who I am familiar with from my hometown, Raymond.  Madge attempted to contact him and was given his cell phone number and the positive news that he wasn't in Raymond, but there in Coutts where our road trip was halted.  Despite having his voice cut out throughout our conversation, I was able to catch him on his cell and learned that he was busy on the Sweetgrass side of the border but that he was willing to post bond on my car (bond that the car was compliant) so I could import it.  

And we waited.

And waited more.

After an hour of waiting, I called him again and we managed to meet.  He took down the info he needed, took some pictures of the car, its airbags, speedometer, and stickers, and told me to again cross the border and go to a brokerage office and await a fax from him.  

We were waived through the border, as everyone in the office had seen me come in and plead my case two times and luckily the female officer at the window came across rather sympathetic.  She actually offered to tell me how to get to the office I needed to find!  The others I had dealt with earlier even neglected to even tell me that in the lobby of the office was a pay-phone that I could have made all my calls from, and hence would have avoided two trips BACK to Canada.  

Finally feeling like we'd caught a break and that we'd actually be able to continue our journey before Monday.  (We were bearing the additional pressure that Isopraxis has a non-refundable plane ticket for Monday morning from San Diego to Calgary.)  But despite our hopes to get moving before sunset, we waited.  

And waited.

About an hour of waiting in the brokerage office for nothing more than two faxed pieces of paper, and feeling like exhausted zombies, we heard the pleasant hum of the fax machine and walked into customs two minutes later.  Luckily I'd already filled out all other forms necessary so in another five minutes we were walking to the car with yet another customs officer who just wanted to check the VIN (and who pointed out that the car was manufactured in America).  We were on the road, having only wasted five hours of our precious driving time.  Ugh.

I had last filled the car with gas in Nanton, Alberta and thought it would be reasonable to stop in Shelby Montana to top up the tank.  Having just gotten on the road, and still having 1/2 a tank, according to the gauge, I recalculated that we'd have enough gas to get to Great Falls.  And so we rolled along.  

Just as I drove past Choteau (I believe), I noticed that the needle was dropping faster than I expected, and that we only had about 1/4 of a tank left and about 25 or 30 miles to go.  I almost decided to turn around, but again figured that we'd arrive without running dry.  

But the level indicator seemed to change position as I watched. Soon it was dipping dangerously close to the empty line.  And we still had 20 miles to go.  The map, a 10+ year old road atlas, showed a town, Power, up ahead.  Our only hope was that an a late-night gas station would be open.  Otherwise we'd be stranded yet again.  It was now just before 11:00.

I took the exit to Power and hoped that I'd be able to drive the one mile into town without sputtering to a stop.  I missed the turn on Central Avenue and was suddenly out of town and looking for an approach to turn the car and trailer around.  Maneuvering back into town we found two bars, across the street from each other, that were doing a decent Friday night business, with 5 to 7 pickups in front of each.  If I couldn't find a gas station, I would be obligated to try and hit-up someone in one of the bars to let me siphon some gas or get a get a jerry can full from back at the home place.  

I took the next right and miraculously saw two gas pumps, illuminated by overhead lights, down the hill and across the tracks by the grain elevator.  We had a chance!  As I drove closer, separated by the tracks, it was apparent that there was no attendant on duty, and so I was resigned to go find someone to give us assistance.  

As I pulled back up to the bars, two lean and lanky ranchers were walking from one establishment to the other.  I rolled down the window and called out to them, asking if they knew of someplace that I could get some gas.  One, asking how much I needed, said that he had a credit card that would work with pumps just down the hill and would get me as much gas as I had cash.

Seven dollars isn't enough cash to travel with in the dreary wastes of Northern Montana.  Thus a second potential title, dealing with my lack of travel wisdom.  (Yet somehow as I type this, as Isopraxis is driving through Northern Nevada, I'm carrying only a blend of American and Canadian change.  But my brother has pulled a few bucks out and is doing a good job looking over me as my elder brother. :) I'm glad he rode along.)

The cash I had would be sufficient to get to Great Falls, so the local boys were going to tell their pals that they were going to give us a hand and would meet us at the pump.  I drove down and noticed that they weren't special key-lock pumps (though they could dispense dyed agricultural gas) but that any major credit card would be accepted.  So for my second lucky break of the day we were going to get sufficient quantities of fuel without getting stranded and having to walk for miles.  Well, second MAJOR lucky break - if I can even call it luck.  Perhaps I should say "Despite my naivety and seeming impossibility."  I'd like to think that tenacity is somewhat involved, but that would be giving me too much credit in the situation.  Perhaps is just blind determination and high levels of stress and commitment.  

Thus the title.  

Our journey was halted in Coutts/Sweetgrass and the peril of being without fuel (literally powerless), 20 miles from the nearest bed, had been averted. 

We rolled into Great Falls just after 11 o'clock and were both about ready to collapse of exhaustion.  I'd been up since 5 AM and had driven the entire way (of my own choice).  We found a place to eat and a cheap hotel (smoking room but it was the only one left and a double at that - yay!).  Sleep soon found my tired eyes, and morning arrived far to soon - but not soon enough.

Our 6 AM wake up call never happened, and I didn't stir enough to check my watch until just before 8. 

And there are many more miles to go.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Things have been quite busy for me at work lately.  As I'm living alone (for the moment), I don't mind staying late at work and trying to get ahead.  Unfortunately, by the time I get home, all I have time to do is chat with Madge for a bit and then fall asleep.  I have made no time for writing new entries, or completing old ones, though I have a lot to say.

In moving to San Diego, and having a new baby in the next few weeks, I decided to find an apartment as close as possible to work.  That way I could come home at lunch and give Madge a hand, and be home right after leaving work.  I hate the idea of commuting, doubly so here in traffic-central, California.

Luckily, I found a great place, just around the corner from work, and it wasn't nearly as expensive as everyone at work tried to tell me it would be.  Unfortunately, we're changing offices.

But not until October.  

This morning, after deciding I didn't need to waste a perfectly good Saturday at work, I decide to go for a ride to check out the new office.  A few of us from work drove by it yesterday afternoon, and I figured it would be a relatively direct ride from the apartment.  From the new office, I could see the "bottom" of a valley whose "top" I was quite sure was right next to the apartment.  Some landmarks strongly suggested this, so I wanted to go for a ride to confirm my thesis.  On a map it looked like quite a direct route, except for one problem.  A six lane (each way) freeway right between the valley bottom and the office.

"Freeway, schmeeway..." I think as I put my bike together and clip on my helmet.   If I <strong>want</strong> to find a route, it will be found!

When I had first come to look at this apartment, I arrived a bit early and decided to wander around the neighbourhood a bit.  At the end of the parking area for this complex of apartments, I noticed a dirt trail leading down a valley.  I'm a big fan of natural beauty, as opposed to the expanse of man's developments, so before checking out the apartment, I wandered down the valley a bit.  I saw a few lizards and wondered where the trail lead.

Well, my trusty old bike and I were determined to connect this valley to the new office of work.  So I headed, quickly, down this sandy trail.  It appears to have been established by the power company for planting power poles.  Down down I go, occasionally hitting patches of soft, unstable sand.  It wasn't too steep, but steep enough to make it a fun ride down.  Going up will be no worse than going up one of the easier faces of Nose Hill in Calgary.  Soon I was at the bottom and, hurray, I could see the building of the new office.  

I followed a paved road North and in not too long I was able to turn right, cross the railroad tracks and go under the freeway.  One right turn and I was on the road running in front of the building I wanted to find.  I poked around the building a bit, just checking it out, and decided to try and find a different route from the office back to the end of the dirt trail.  I continued South until I had another chance to go under the freeway.  I figured this route (South under the freeway instead of North), would be a bit shorter, but only if I could get back across the railroad tracks (and creek) to the trail up the valley.


This is where the adventure began.  I knew where I wanted to go, and tried over and over to get there.  I found a bridge over the creek, but on the other side there was only a parking lot.  Beside it were the train tracks, but no visible path over it or along it (on either side) that I could follow.  I poked around some more, following the creek until it crossed under the tracks.  I decided that this was my chance to cross the tracks.  I did so, but still had the creek in my way.  I'm rather fearful of trains, as they always arrive faster than you expect, so I didn't want to cross over the creek on the tracks. 

Unfortunately, the only thing keeping me from climbing back up the valley and home, was the creek.  I didn't want to follow along it any farther, so I doubled back, and crossed over on the train bridge.  Just after I crossed, I was dawdling a bit, looking at a prickly-pear cactus.  Suddenly I heard a "TOOT" and knew it was meant for me.

I rolled off the tracks and surprisingly found a path back through the brush toward the valley trail.  An AMTRACK train cruised past as I disappeared into the brush.  Soon, after pushing through some tall wild-mustard, I was heading up the valley.  I'd had fun <a href="http://www.cogsci.princeton.edu/cgi-bin/webwn?stage=1&#38;word=bushwhacking">bushwhacking</a> from the freeway to this point, so instead of rolling up the path I came down on, I decided to turn off and try another route.  

And what a route I found.

First, I had to walk up one of the steepest dirt slopes that I wouldn't consider a cliff.  A few sips of water and I was rolling along the plateau, approximately level with the apartment.  But I was a long distance from home, yet.  I could see some office buildings, each one at a point, surrounded by little valleys leading down into the the trail valley or back toward the freeway.  I curiously checked almost every one out, looking for additional paths that could be used at a later date, or that could carry me home.  One building, the IDE Center for Communication Research, had a surprising number of cameras around it, and a bare "path" outside its fenced area.  It jutted out above the valleys and I hoped a path would lead down from it, back toward home.  

It didn't, and I spend 15 minutes slowly rolling all the way around the compound, coming out with a gentleman standing outside the building, probably wondering who kept appearing on all the cameras and what I was doing.  No path could be found, and the native brush looked far to intimidating and steep to bike through.

I checked out more offices, and could see the far end of the apartment complex, just across a little valley.  An office building (and its fences and bushes) didn't allow me to cut across the top (and I didn't want to ride the boring roads), so I decided I'd have some "fun" and go around the building, through the brush on the side of the valley.  

The route home thus far had been OK.  It wasn't the most efficient way to the office but it let me check out the area a bit.  My private <a href="http://www.ecochallenge.com/">Eco-Challenge</a> started the moment I decided to descend to a flat rim on the edge of the valley.  

I could see some dirt along this rim, and figured that, between the sage and other brush, I'd be able to ride through it once I got down.  But going down was the easy part.  The dry brush was sharp, rough and smelly and my shins stung as I tried to pedal and push my way through.  Soon I was off my bike, then carrying it on my shoulder as the tall rough plants enveloped me.  I imagined I could see a trail at times, yet it wasn't meant for man or bike.  I hadn't the force to push the bike through ahead of me, nor the strength to pull it behind.  If I carried it, I was caught at every move by some <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=define:bramble&#38;ie=UTF-8&#38;oe=UTF-8">bramble</a> or branch.  

My Eco-Challenge was through the native valley growth, and though I knew where I was and where I needed to go, I didn't know when I'd make it.  I was well equipped with water, but I feared finding a snake den or other creature.  My bike was holding me back, but I couldn't leave it behind.  Finally, I hefted it above my head, out of the reach of Mother Nature, and pushed my burning shins through the curtain of scabrous bushes.  

I don't know how far I walked like this.  The distance, from above, may have been short, but each agonizing step was a feat in itself.  The land did not want me to cross.  But I got myself into this, and the only way out was the one that I must make.  

Showing only a little blood, but lots of dirt, pollen, and dust on my legs and arms, I emerged onto land that I envisioned riding across.  Enough bare patches existed that I could ride (or coast) along, but still each spot of scrub would lash out and strike my tender legs.  A digital camera would have nicely captured some great images as I discovered a cactus growing on the edge of a rocky outcropping overlooking the valley.  Glad I was that I hadn't found one with my front tire.  Two golf balls I also found - sun-bleached to the point that the outer surface rubbed away with each touch.  

Soon I was on yet another island, surrounded by valley walls and thick brush I did not want to cross.  Apartments were just on the other side of a very small valley - but how to get there?  I spied a large cactus and a bare patch of ground, running down the hillside, beside it.  Hopefully it would lead me to the clear base of the valley (which was obviously the haven of the local kids - the perfect place for a fort and well trampled).  It did, and I'm glad.  I'd had all the fun I needed by this point.  And all I wanted was some shade and a shower.

But you may say, if this was an self-inflicted Eco-Challenge, where were the bugs and other nasties?

Well, I found no leeches, or killer-bees, and only empty snail shells, but as I rolled up the street to my home, I spied a critter, that I truly fear, crawling on my leg.  

A <a href="http://entomology.ucdavis.edu/faculty/rbkimsey/tickbio.html">tick</a>.  I hate <a href="http://entomology.ucdavis.edu/faculty/rbkimsey/caticks.html">ticks</a> (Ixodidae).  I'm afraid of them and luckily have never had one burrow into my skin and grow.  I <strong>never</strong> want to have that happen.  

I flicked it off and found another on the other leg.   I hadn't had my head in the brush that much, so I hoped I didn't have any in my thick locks of hair.  When I got home, I found two more on my legs, both looking for a nice warm place to burrow.  Quickly I pulled off my clothes and checked for more, but that was all.  I'm quite certain that the ticks that found me while I pushed through the brush were <a href="http://entomology.ucdavis.edu/faculty/rbkimsey/Doccide.gif">Dermacentor Occidentalis</a> (Pacific Coast Ticks) and not the more dangerous <a href="http://entomology.ucdavis.edu/faculty/rbkimsey/Danders.gif">Dermacentor Andersoni</a> (Rocky  Mountain Wood Tick).  

Sunburned, sweaty, tired and scraped, I'd survived.  But I promise you that I'll never try and ride <em><strong>that</strong></em> route to the new office.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I presume, based on the lack of feedback I've received, that the people looking for an Xcode Tutorial are people <em>relatively</em> new to the world of computer programming.  You've probably dabbled a bit, but you're not ready to get down and dirty and experimentally learn how the tool works.  You want a leg up on the learning curve.  Hopefully this tutorial can give you that start.  

<h4>What is Xcode</h4>
Essentially <a href="http://developer.apple.com/tools/xcode/">Xcode</a> is a tool that acts as a project organizer, text editor, compiler, debugger and documentation viewer.  Comparable Windows software would be Microsoft Visual Studio.  Xcode (formerly known as Project Builder) allows most development to be completed within a single window, putting important tools a single click away.  It is built upon "open source" tools such as gcc (for compilation) and gdb (for debugging).  The <a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CocoaOverview/Articles/DevelopmentEnviron.html">Xcode suite</a> also includes other applications including Interface Builder that support <a href="http://developer.apple.com/cocoa/index.html">Cocoa</a> (Objective-C/Java), <a href="http://developer.apple.com/carbon/index.html">Carbon</a> (Procedural C), and <a href="http://www.apple.com/applescript/studio/index.html">Applescript Studio</a> (Applescript) projects.  Apple's Xcode suite page can be found <a href="http://developer.apple.com/tools/macosxtools.html">here</a>.

People interested in an Xcode Tutorial most likely aren't looking for information on how to use these extra tools and languages, so I'm not going to talk about them.  Plus, many other tutorials exist both at <a href="http://developer.apple.com/macosx/gettingstarted/">Apple</a> and <a href="http://macdevcenter.com/">MacDevCenter</a> (check the sidebar for topics).

<h4>Xcode Project Types</h4>
Every project begins at the New Project Assistant (File, New...).  As of Xcode 1.1 the list of available projects is:
<div class="imgright"><a href="http://www.skipandmadge.com/photos/misc_xcode/NewProjectAssistant.png" onclick="window.open('http://www.skipandmadge.com/photos/misc_xcode/NewProjectAssistant.png','popup','width=516,height=566,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=yes,left=0,top=0');return false"><img src="http://www.skipandmadge.com/photos/misc_xcode/NewProjectAssistant-tm.jpg" height="291" width="266" border="0" alt="NewProjectAssistant" /></a><br />
New Project Assistant
</div>

Many other project types are selectable under the <strong>bold</strong> groups but will not be covered.  A text window under the list of selectable project types give a brief definition of the currently highlighted project type.  As can be seen at the right, I have selected a "Standard Tool" project that "... builds a command-line tool written in C."  Other options that may be of interest include the "C++ Tool" (command-line tool that links against the stdc++ library) and the various Java Applet, Application, and Tool types.  The CoreFoundation, CoreServices and Foundation Tools also build command-line tools but these link against the Cocoa libraries and are written in Objective-C.

<div class="imgleft"><a href="http://www.skipandmadge.com/photos/misc_xcode/NewStandardTool.png" onclick="window.open('http://www.skipandmadge.com/photos/misc_xcode/NewStandardTool.png','popup','width=516,height=566,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=yes,left=0,top=0');return false"><img src="http://www.skipandmadge.com/photos/misc_xcode/NewStandardTool-tm.jpg" height="291" width="266" border="0" alt="NewStandardTool" /></a><br />
New Standard Tool
</div>
Picking the "Standard Tool" option and clicking "Next" brings us to a pane where we can give our project a name and pick where we want to save the project.  The default save location is "~/" (the base of your home folder).  This is where your "Documents," "Music," and "Movies" folders reside.  I usually save my projects in "~/Documents/Dev/".  Give the project the name, "BasicTool," save it in your preferred location, and click "Finish."  (Allow Xcode to create any directories as needed.)

You are now presented with the main Xcode development window.  The right pane shows the uncompiled Build Target <em>BasicTool</em> (the program you are going to build and compile) in red, a file used for documenting the Target <em>BasicTool.1</em>, and the source code file <em>main.c</em>.  The left pane is organized to rapidly present all potentially relevant information about the project.  The "folders" of information are merely logical groupings of files.  <div class="imgright"><a href="http://www.skipandmadge.com/misc_xcode/NewProjectWindow.png" onclick="window.open('http://www.skipandmadge.com/misc_xcode/NewProjectWindow.png','popup','width=600,height=383,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=yes,left=0,top=0');return false"><img src="http://www.skipandmadge.com/misc_xcode/NewProjectWindow-tm.jpg" height="169" width="266" border="0" alt="NewProjectWindow" /></a><br />New Project Window</div>For example, under the 
<em>BasicTool</em> project "folder" (the topmost group), once you click the disclosure triangle to its left, you see three folders.  These folders, Source, Documentation, and Products, "contain" the same three files as in the left plane, but the file's presence in a specific "folder" is only for presentation.  Moving the files in these folders does <strong>not</strong> change their location on the filesystem.  You <em>can</em> make high-level changes to these items, however.  For example, by control-clicking main.c (in either pane), you are presented with a number of options, including <em>Reveal in Finder</em>, <em>Get Info</em>, and <em>Rename</em>.  

You may notice that the files shown in the right pane are the same files contained within the selected grouping (folder) in the left pane.  That is, if you select <em>Implementation Files</em>, the only file shown in the right pane will be <em>main.c</em> as it is our only source file.

For the moment, we will simply leave these folders as they were originally as we won't be using them just yet.  

<h4>Source Code Editor</h4>
One of the main uses of Xcode is as a source code editor.  Any basic text-editing application (<strong>not</strong> Word Processor) will give you the same basic capabilities.  Xcode has some features that make it nicer to use than many editors, however.  

There are several ways to call up an editing window in Xcode.  At this point we will only look at two ways.  The first is by double clicking main.c in the right (or left) pane of the window.  This action causes a new editor window to popup.  <br />
<div class="imgleft"><a href="http://www.skipandmadge.com/misc_xcode/NewEditorWindow.png" onclick="window.open('http://www.skipandmadge.com/misc_xcode/NewEditorWindow.png','popup','width=531,height=316,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=yes,left=0,top=0');return false"><img src="http://www.skipandmadge.com/misc_xcode/NewEditorWindow-tm.jpg" height="158" width="266" border="0" alt="NewEditorWindow" /></a><br />Basic Editor Window</div>We will examine the window as three segments.  Later we will add an additional segment or two, but for now the window segments will be referred to as the <strong>Tool Bar</strong> - the buttons at the top of the window, the <strong>Shortcut Bar</strong> - the small buttons immediately above the source code and the <strong>Text Field</strong> - the actual area containing source code.  

The Tool Bar buttons are separated into two groups.  The left group are used for Building, Executing and Debugging the Target executable, while the right group governs the editor interface.  

The Shortcut Bar is a row of buttons used for quickly jumping to relevant sections of code in the file currently being edited, or in other files in the same project (other .c and .h files, for example).  The Text Field (as configured) only shows the code from one source file.  Many source files can be open, however, but rather than having one window for each file, the interface allows you to move Forward and Back between open files by using the two arrowheads on the left side of the Shortcut Bar.  The View menu (at the top of the screen) shows the keyboard shortcuts for moving to the Previous File, the Next File, and to Switch to Header/Source File.  The Shortcut Bar buttons are a fast and effective method of flipping from source file to source file, while avoiding the tedium of managing an incredible number of windows.  As our project only has one source file, the buttons are grayed out and inaccessible.

Next is a button that also lets you jump from open source file (not necessarily <a href="http://www.opensource.org/">Open Source</a> ) to open source file (or other files previously accessed), but avoids any Previous/Next dependencies.  It also displays the line of code where the cursor is located (:1).  To the right of this button is one that allows you to jump from symbol to symbol within the current source file.  These <em>symbols</em> include function names, and #defines.  The other buttons in the row are for jumping to code bookmarks, breakpoints, corresponding header/source files, and to included files.  

Just to the right of the last button, and just below the row of Shortcut buttons is a button used to split the text field in half.   Clicking this button gives us effectively two text field, each with its own Shortcut Bar, that allows you to work on two sections of code (in different files) at the same time within the same window.  The text fields can each show the same source file, and, if the same segment of code is visible in both panes, the second pane will show the changes that you make in the first pane in real time.  As you edit the source file, the icon next to the file name and line number in the Shortcut Bar ("main.c:8", for example) will darken.  This is a visual cue that the file has not been saved since it has last been modified.  Saving the file will cause the icon to appear normally, and other files shown when that Shortcut Bar button is clicked also represent their status (modified/saved) by their icon.

If you have made any changes to the code, to see the icon change its shading, first save the file (cmd+S), and <strong>then</strong> undo (cmd+Z) your changes.  In most applications, the list of items that can be undone is erased once the file is saved.  Xcode, however, allows us to even undo to points <em>preceding</em> a save.  You will be prompted to confirm whether you want to undo past the last point the file was saved.  Click "Undo" and continue undoing until all the changes have been removed.

Now, close the editor window or click on the Project button in the Tool Bar.  We should now be back at the main project window.  In the toolbar for this window, a button that looks like the project window exists.  Its default location is between the stop sign and the magnifying glass buttons.  This <strong>Show Editor</strong> button causes a text editor pane to appear within the Project window, dividing the right pane in half.  <br /><br /><div class="imgleft"><a href="http://www.skipandmadge.com/misc_xcode/ProjectWindowWithSplitEditor.png" onclick="window.open('http://www.skipandmadge.com/misc_xcode/ProjectWindowWithSplitEditor.png','popup','width=608,height=434,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=yes,left=0,top=0');return false"><img src="http://www.skipandmadge.com/misc_xcode/ProjectWindowWithSplitEditor-tm.jpg" height="189" width="266" border="0" alt="ProjectWindowWithSplitEditor" /></a><br />Project Window with Split Editor Panes</div>As you can see, this editor is the same as the one that popped up when when we double clicked main.c (other than the Tool Bar buttons).  This editor pane includes the Shortcut Bar and can again be split in half.  Previous version of ProjectBuilder would allow you to split the editor pane into more than two text fields.  Perhaps this capability will return in future versions of Xcode as it can be quite handy.  Typically, however, two text fields, combined with the other Shortcut buttons for jumping between and within files, will be sufficient for most situations.  

The two text fields can be minimized back to one by grabbing the rightmost button in the Shortcut bar of the bottom text field (it is actually a handle as indicated by the double horizontal lines), and dragging the shortcut bar as far up as possible.  We're now ready to edit the code, and build and debug the executable.

<h4>Build and Debug</h4>
When developing, the two steps in the process that often "waste" the most time are the Build and Debug steps.  If a segment of code is properly planned out, it takes a relatively small amount of time to actually type it in.  But, if you're writing a linked-list from scratch (or doing other pointer operations), a rather trivial problem, such as using an invalid array index, can take hours and hours to locate.  The integration of the command line gdb debugger into Xcode makes the hunt and elimination of runtime errors relatively painless (depending on the location of the error and your personal debugging skills, naturally).  

So lets take this Hello World code and add in a common runtime error and a syntax error.  Add the following lines of code <strong>exactly</strong> as they appear between <span style="font-size: 11px; font-family: monospace;">//insert code here...</span> and <span style="font-size: 11px; font-family: monospace;">printf("Hello, World!\n");</span> (and don't fix the syntax error).

<div class="code">int temp[3] = {1,2,3};<br />
	int result = 0;<br />
	<br />
	result = temp[1] - temp[3] * temp[2]);<br />
	printf("%i\n", result);</div>

To build the code, click on the left hammer button in the Tool Bar.  

<div class="imgright"><a href="http://www.skipandmadge.com/misc_xcode/SyntaxError.png" onclick="window.open('http://www.skipandmadge.com/misc_xcode/SyntaxError.png','popup','width=608,height=434,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=yes,left=0,top=0');return false"><img src="http://www.skipandmadge.com/misc_xcode/SyntaxError-tm.jpg" height="189" width="266" border="0" alt="SyntaxError" /></a><br />Syntax Error</div>Just below the Tool Bar we can see that the Build Failed (1 error).  The Errors and Warnings group in the left pane is no longer grayed out, and we can see a red circle with a white X next to the line of code with the syntax error.  If we click the "Errors and Warnings" disclosure triangle (in the left pane), and click on main.c, we will see the error message generated by the compiler (gcc) in the right pane above the text field.  The message tells us that the code parser failed before the ')' token.  
<br />
<div class="imgleft"><a href="http://www.skipandmadge.com/misc_xcode/ErrorMessage.png" onclick="window.open('http://www.skipandmadge.com/misc_xcode/ErrorMessage.png','popup','width=608,height=434,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=yes,left=0,top=0');return false"><img src="http://www.skipandmadge.com/misc_xcode/ErrorMessage-tm.jpg" height="189" width="264" border="0" alt="ErrorMessage" /></a><br />Error Message</div>
From the point of view of the parser, based on the previous tokens in that line of code, something else should have appeared <em>before</em> the right parenthesis (such as a left parenthesis).  We will interpret this message as indicating <strong>not</strong> that something should have preceded the parenthesis, but that it, itself, is out of place.  Delete the erroneous round bracket, but instead of clicking on the build hammer, click on the build and run hammer - the hammer with the green circle and arrowhead.  This button will not only compile the executable, but run it once it has successfully completed compiling and linking.
<div class="imgright"><a href="http://www.skipandmadge.com/misc_xcode/BuildAndRunwithError.png" onclick="window.open('http://www.skipandmadge.com/misc_xcode/BuildAndRunwithError.png','popup','width=639,height=267,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=yes,left=0,top=0');return false"><img src="http://www.skipandmadge.com/misc_xcode/BuildAndRunwithError-tm.jpg" height="111" width="266" border="0" alt="BuildAndRunwithError" /></a><br />Runtime Error</div>
A "Run" window now pops up and we can see that the application successfully executed and exited.  However, our short line of array math didn't calculate the sum we expected.  The image above shows the number -7 before the output of "Hello, World!" whereas we would expect the value -5 (1-3*2).  The error in this contrived example would be rather trivial to pinpoint without even using the traditional method of inserting <span style="font-size: 11px; font-family: monospace;">printf</span> statements throughout suspect code segments.  We would simply look for the line of code where the value of result is calculated and examine its references.  

This same error, however, could easily be buried within an incrementing loop inside a function call buried deep within the source tree.  By memory, it would be difficult to recall the location of the math routine and observe the error.  Even <span style="font-size: 11px; font-family: monospace;">printf</span> statements would take far too long, as this style of error may not evidence itself every time the snippet is used as the result may at times appear reasonable or not stand out.  

Instead, we'll track this bug down with the modern equivalent of printfs, breakpoints.  First click the Debug button (the bugspray icon is amusingly appropriate).  

A Debug window now appears.  It has its own set of Tool Bar buttons and three window segments.  The bottom segment is another source code editor with all the Shortcut features.  Above it are a listing of threads on the left (which we will completely ignore) and a list of variables in the right pane.  First lets place a breakpoint at the line <span style="font-size: 11px; font-family: monospace;">// insert code here...</span>.  We insert breakpoints by clicking in the left grey sidebar next to the line desired.  Placed breakpoints can be moved by dragging them up and down and removed (deleted) by dragging them left or right of the sidebar.  

Now click the Debug button in the Tool Bar.  You can click Build and Debug, but as we haven't modified the code yet, it makes no difference.  We can now see our breakpoint, and a red arrow (also in the sidebar) pointing at the first line of code after the comment.  If our breakpoint didn't point at the comment, but at the line beneath, the arrow would still be pointing at the same line of code.  The red highlighted line of code <strong>has not yet been</strong> executed.  In the Variables pane, click the disclosure triangle next to <span style="font-size: 11px; font-family: monospace;">temp</span> to see the contents of the array <strong>before</strong> it is initialized.

<div class="imgleft"><a href="http://www.skipandmadge.com/misc_xcode/DebugBreakpoint.png" onclick="window.open('http://www.skipandmadge.com/misc_xcode/DebugBreakpoint.png','popup','width=745,height=520,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=yes,left=0,top=0');return false"><img src="http://www.skipandmadge.com/misc_xcode/DebugBreakpoint-tm.jpg" height="185" width="266" border="0" alt="DebugBreakpoint" /></a><br />Debug Window with Breakpoint highlighted</div>Next, we step through the code, watching the values of <span style="font-size: 11px; font-family: monospace;">temp</span> and <span style="font-size: 11px; font-family: monospace;">result</span>.  Before we pick which Step button to use, lets open the Console drawer so that we can see the program's output.  The double arrows at the end of the toolbar (if your window is narrow), contains the Console Drawer button.  Clicking this button causes the a drawer to appear at the bottom of the window.  The drawer is filled with the output from the debugger as it loads the binary and arrives at the breakpoint.  If your program contained <span style="font-size: 11px; font-family: monospace;">scanf</span> code, you would use this drawer to enter input.

We can choose one of two Step buttons to push (ignoring the other two).  <strong>Step Over</strong> will cause the debugger to execute the highlighted code and then stop before the next line, while Step Instruction will actually step through the assembler instructions one by one.  With Step Instruction you can tell that you have completed all the instructions that are part of the line of code when the arrow moves and highlights the next line of code.  We will Step Instructions until the next line is highlighted, so that we can watch each array element get initialized.  

We don't see the instructions themselves (at least not yet), but after 7 clicks, <span style="font-size: 11px; font-family: monospace;">temp[0]</span> will get initialized to <span style="font-size: 11px; font-family: monospace;">1</span> and appear red in the Variable pane (the value will be red, not the variable).  Two more clicks and are ready to Step Over the initialization of <span style="font-size: 11px; font-family: monospace;">result</span>.      We can also Step Over the calculation of <span style="font-size: 11px; font-family: monospace;">result</span> and see the incorrect value (in this case <span style="font-size: 11px; font-family: monospace;">-7</span>) in red.  As seen accurately in the Variable pane, the array values were correctly initialized but could in no way be combined, as constrained by this algorithm, to produce the value <span style="font-size: 11px; font-family: monospace;">-7</span>.  We only have one line of code that could be faulty, and, after having it stare us in the face for a few minutes, it will inevitably dawn on us that we're using invalid indices to access the array.  

If we were to Terminate the debugger (by clicking the Stop sign) and begin the process again by clicking Debug, we could actually watch the processor's registers  as we stepped through the code, assembley instruction by instruction.  If you wish to do so, click the Debug menu, Disassembly Display and then click the disclosure triangle next to <span style="font-size: 11px; font-family: monospace;">Registers</span> in the Variable Pane.

First we see <span style="font-size: 11px; font-family: monospace;">$r0</span>, <span style="font-size: 11px; font-family: monospace;">$r9</span>, and <span style="font-size: 11px; font-family: monospace;">$r2</span> get filled with the array values, and then we see those values get stored in the appropriate memory locations.   Next, <span style="font-size: 11px; font-family: monospace;">$r2</span> gets loaded with the valid but incorrect array value, <span style="font-size: 11px; font-family: monospace;">$r0</span> is loaded with the value <span style="font-size: 11px; font-family: monospace;">3</span> from an <em>invalid</em> memory location, and result is then calculated by multiplying <span style="font-size: 11px; font-family: monospace;">$r2</span> and <span style="font-size: 11px; font-family: monospace;">$r0</span>, and placing the product in <span style="font-size: 11px; font-family: monospace;">$r2</span>.  Once this is completed the value <span style="font-size: 11px; font-family: monospace;">2</span> is loaded into <span style="font-size: 11px; font-family: monospace;">$r0</span> and, subtracting <span style="font-size: 11px; font-family: monospace;">$r2</span> from <span style="font-size: 11px; font-family: monospace;">$r0</span>, the sum is stored in <span style="font-size: 11px; font-family: monospace;">$r0</span> and output to the console. 

Such a fine level of inspection cannot be matched with <span style="font-size: 11px; font-family: monospace;">printf</span>, nor can it be <em>so</em> easily accessed and observed by using <span style="font-size: 11px; font-family: monospace;">gdb</span> on the command line.  (I have no experience with <span style="font-size: 11px; font-family: monospace;">ddd</span>, though I hope it works in a similar fashion to Xcode.)

Once the array indices have each been decremented, making them valid, Terminate the debugger (Stop Sign button) and close the window, returning to the Run window.  Now Build and Run to see the program execute as expected.  

Congratulations, you've now exercised the major portions of Xcode that are useful for basic command line projects.  Save it, close it, or use it as the base for a new (or new to Xcode) project.

<h4>Conclusion</h4>
Most academic and beginner level programming can be accomplished simply with a text editor and a command line compiler.  For the most part, a full blown IDE (such as Xcode) is not necessary.  However, access to a robust and well thought out IDE can speed and ease the task of development at any level.  The main obstacle for beginners, that keeps them from using an IDE, is the additional learning curve involved as you fight the IDE to get it to do what you want.  If the Development Environment gets in your way, what's the point in using it, right?

Hopefully this brief tutorial has given enough insight into the layout, options and features of Xcode to make it accessible to any programmer looking to enhance his conventional development methodology.  Please feel free to comment and demand further clarity or to suggest corrections and other topics to cover.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[The trip that Isopraxis and I took from <a href="http://maps.yahoo.com/dd_result?ed=ZrJj7eV.wimpkMQ.ncoT45L8E9YM4kez2PvOrsn2yKu8d7l3Ok8nBTxtSm9Mf_AMcRZIenV._g--&#38;csz=Calgary%2C+Alberta&#38;country=ca&#38;tcsz=San+Diego%2C+CA+92121-3033&#38;tcountry=us">Calgary, Alberta, Canada to San Diego, California, USA</a>, took a total travel time (including gassing up and eating) about 34 hours.  Luckily I had access to an old Powerbook (G3 400) and I have my entire music collection on a portable 80 GB Firewire hard drive.  I also borrowed an AC Inverter so we could run the whole setup while the car was on.  Playing it through a cassette adapter was satisfactory, and the endless supply of music allowed us to pick tracks that fit the situation.   

iTunes was used to generate playlists, but we ran into a problem.  If, in the middle of a 6 hour playlist, we stopped the car and had to resume the playlist, any tracks that we had previously played would again be available in the randomized list.  We needed to be able to generate a Smart Playlist whose contents would be based on a standard playlist, but with the ability to only include songs that hadn't been previously played on the trip.  Unfortunately, Smart Playlists were not given such a capacity, <strong>at that time</strong>.

Less than two weeks after arriving, <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/">iTunes 4.5</a> (for Mac and Windows) was released, and among many more interesting features, the ability to base a Smart Playlist on other Playlist<strong>s</strong> (Smart or otherwise) is included.  It wouldn't have saved our lives, but it was an obvious feature that needed to be included.

The music we played was of quite varied styles.  Somehow, despite our 7 year age difference, and growing up mostly apart, Isopraxis and I have <strong>shockingly similar</strong> tastes in music.  We've talked about it several times and can't decide if it was genetic or environmental.  Our strong tendency toward <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronica">electronic music</a> (electro) we think may stem from the endless hours each of us spent driving a tractor around and around the family farm's fields.  The rhythmic hum of the diesel engine and the odd vibrations combined in ways that weren't really musical, but that I came to recognize and know.  

Endlessly driving in circles, watching the swarming seagulls and trying to drive perfectly straight, left lots of time for imagining and thinking.  Noise turned to rhythm and rhythm was companionship.  I quite hated doing it, but it was good for me none-the-less.  If anyone ever wonders why I don't mind working alone, I should cite my early training.

So I figured it could be of interest to list the tracks that helped us make this 2600 km (1600 miles) bearable.  iTunes nicely generated a Smart Playlist of all the songs listened to from April 16 to April 19, 2004.  A feature also exists where you can export the information for every track in a playlist as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xml">XML</a> (or plain text).  Next I wanted to convert this data into a human readable HTML table, and I hoped I wouldn't have to program a solution to this task on my own.

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xml">Versiontracker</a> , when I searched for "xml itunes," nicely pointed me toward <a href="http://www.maczsoftware.com/phptunest/">phptunest</a>, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Php">php</a> script that will convert iTunes XML data to HTML (and do nifty sorting and whatnot).  I grabbed phptunest, edited the configuration according to the instructions, and moved my .xml file into the same directory as the script, but I didn't want to run the php script through a browser (as is the common way to execute php).  So I decided to try out the terminal.  The command:

<div class="code">[hostname:~] username% php tunes.php</div>

Seemed to take its time doing something, and then returned me to the blank prompt.  A quick check in the finder and <strong>voila</strong> an .html file was awaiting.  A few more tweaks to the settings file, and I had three more tables built, each with a different track sorting.

If you're interested in looking through the track listing, you can look at it in the <a href="http://www.skipandmadge.com/archives/orderplayed.html">original order played</a>, or sorted by <a href="http://www.skipandmadge.com/archives/artistorder.html">artist</a>, <a href="http://www.skipandmadge.com/archives/albumorder.html">album</a> or track <a href="http://www.skipandmadge.com/archives/nameorder.html">name</a>.  

One day, 20 hours and 15 minutes of music and spoken word - and <strong>NO REPEATS </strong>.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[My first introduction to hockey was in the early/mid 80's when my brother-in-law Doug watched the <a href="http://www.edmontonoilers.com/">Edmonton Oilers</a> play in the Stanley Cup playoffs.  In the late 80's, I occasionally followed the playoffs when <em>my</em> team, the Oilers, were playing.  I always enjoyed watching <a href="http://www.edmontonoilers.com/gallery/fuhr">Grant Fuhr</a> work his magic.  

Edmonton, however, was not the popular team in school.  <strong>The</strong> team to cheer for was decidedly the <a href="http://www.calgaryflames.com">Calgary Flames</a>.  I most certainly was <strong>not</strong> a Calgary fan.  I liked the city, but when it came to hockey and football, the Edmonton teams were always my pick.  

About the last year that Fuhr played for Edmonton was the last time I really followed the playoffs.  Regular season hockey has little appeal to me.  There's not much at stake and you can tell when you watch the games (or else its just my attitude).  But something different happened this year, and I'm following the playoffs with real intent.

You see, I've been living in Calgary for about the last 8 years.  I'm still an Edmonton Eskimos fan, but I enjoy seeing Calgary do well.  I also still prefer the Oilers, but when Calgary made the playoffs, and Edmonton didn't, something clicked and I've really been keen on watching Calgary win (and cheering them on).  Its been many years (8?) since Calgary even made the playoffs, and tonight they even beat the Detroit RedWings to make it into the final four (or third round).  

But there's been a problem.  I've been living in San Diego for the past three weeks, and I don't have cable, and worse than that, I don't even have a TV.  I have listened to a couple of games over the internet, but, while better than nothing, its just not as good as watching it.  So what do I do?  Hmmm, well, one day, as I was video-conferencing with Madge and Lilo with iChat, I realized that they could probably sit the iBook in front of the TV, aim the iSight at it, and with any luck I'd be able to <strong>see and hear</strong>  every minute of the action.  

I was afraid that the picture would be all flashy - that the camera would pick up the scanning of the TV, but somehow it works out <em>beautifully</em>.   <div class="imgleft"><img src="http://www.skipandmadge.com/misc_skip/flames_vs_redwings1.jpg" height="288" width="352" border="0" alt="flames_vs_redwings1" /><br />Personal Hockey Night in Canada</div>It doesn't matter that <a href="http://www.calgaryflames.com">CalgaryFlames.com</a> only provides an audio stream, all I need are my own family members to set up a private <em>video</em> stream.  The image isn't quite as good as watching a real TV (as I can't see the puck very often), but I can see every hit and follow the action live.  And if I make it full-screen, I can sit right back and enjoy myself.

The game tonight was so good, and I'm so happy (though deep down I don't know why) that <strong>CALGARY WON</strong>.  The Overtime goal, with just seconds left, gave them the series win with a score of 1-0.  Both teams fought hard, and played really well.  A tight, tense match whose outcome I quite like.

It <em>almost</em> makes me wish I owned a jersey.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I had the idea earlier tonight that it might be fun to put a poll on the site to get people's votes on when they think our baby will arrive.  See the sidebar on the right.

Pick one that seems right and click <strong>Vote</strong>.  As individuals in each family may want to vote, I've enabled the ability to vote multiple times.  (Please don't skew the results though, it would be fun to see how close the true average is.)

I've also thought of putting up a second poll for gender voting.  But I'm too tired tonight to figure it out.  

(For those interested, the php script for the poll is fantastic, but doesn't have the greatest instructions in the world.  Its called <a href="http://proxy2.de/scripts.php">Advanced Poll</a> and I got it at <a href="http://proxy2.de/scripts.php">http://proxy2.de/scripts.php</a>.  If you need help installing it, leave a comment.  I should see if I can have email address not publicly displayed anywhere but so that I can contact you personally - if the address is <strong>valid</strong> of course.  I don't want to help spam harvesters or contribute to a spam problem...)

<strong>Update</strong> - I've incorporated <a href="http://www.nonplus.net/software/mt/MTObfuscate.htm">MTObfuscate</a> into the comments so that your email address (or URL) will not be harvested by spammers and search engines.  It requires that javascript is enabled for your browser.  If you haven't turned javascript off, its probably on and you're fine.  If you want another margin of security, write dut com instead of .com.  It was <a href="http://www.biffard.com/contact.htm">Ryan's idea</a>.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I've been using computers since I was five or six years old.  I remember knowing more about how the computer in my Grade One class worked than the teacher &#8211; because we had one just like it at home!  It was an Apple ][+, and it was great.

<div class="quote">Now, just because I mentioned computers, don't go thinking that this is going to be all technical.  I'll avoid falling into my educated role of a computer engineer and just explain a tendency I've just discovered about myself.

But first some background information, and that's why I mentioned my first computer.</div>

Early on I learned the placement of the various keys on the keyboard.  If I recall correctly (IIRC), the keys were rather stiff and noisy, and I certainly didn't touch type.  But I soon found typing to be more efficient than writing.  

I wasn't the first (but may have been) in my classes to submit printed reports when everyone else just wrote.  Perhaps this speed/efficiency disparity is what has caused me to have rather irregular handwriting &#8211; I just didn't see the value in perfecting it as I already knew of a better way.

It was probably in Grade 4 that I first took a "Computers" class.  Mostly that meant typing practice I think.  <em>"'Tiger in the tall grass,' by I.C. Stripes"</em>  I soon had mastered the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touch_typing">home row</a>, and I haven't left it since.

Now the appearance, in those early days of word processing, of spell checkers made typing a forgiving process (unless of course you wrote "there" instead of "their" and then never proof-read).  In fact, it was a huge feature.

But in this modern era of Internet-enabled computing, spell checking is often an ignored and overlooked feature.  People even make a <a href="http://www.languagehat.com/archives/001110.php">living out of spelling mistakes</a>.

Now, since my early use of Apple Computers products, they remain my preferred tool to use (though I speak Windows and DOS and Linux and French fluently as well).  The most recent iterations of the Mac OS operating system (<a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">OS X</a>) have included a nifty feature that first appeared (IIRC) in Microsoft Word.  That feature is real-time spell checking.

That is, when you misspell a word, it becomes immediately apparent because the word gets a red "underline" mark to signify that it's not a recognized word.<div class="imgright"><a href="http://www.skipandmadge.com/misc_skip/Spelling Mistake.png" onclick="window.open('http://www.skipandmadge.com/misc_skip/Spelling Mistake.png','popup','width=406,height=350,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=yes,left=0,top=0');return false"><img src="http://www.skipandmadge.com/misc_skip/Spelling Mistake-tm.jpg" height="229" width="266" border="0" alt="Spelling Mistake" /></a> <br /> Not a fake error</div>Now, what's unique about this feature is that the capability for real-time spell checking is built into OS X itself.  Any programmer can quite simply tell his program to use the built in checker, and every place that people type, their mistakes could be highlighted.  <strong>EVERY</strong> program <em>could</em> include spell checking with minimal effort.  

So what do you do when you see a word underlined like this?  The easy way is to simply ctrl+click (or right-click) on the incorrect word.  <div class="imgleft"><a href="http://www.skipandmadge.com/misc_skip/spelling_correction.png" onclick="window.open('http://www.skipandmadge.com/misc_skip/spelling_correction.png','popup','width=409,height=516,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=yes,left=0,top=0');return false"><img src="http://www.skipandmadge.com/misc_skip/spelling_correction-tm.jpg" height="335" width="266" border="0" alt="spelling_correction" /></a><br />Correcting the mistake</div>A menu will appear with the suggested words at the top.  Pick the correct one, or Learn/Ignore the word.

However, once I get into a typing groove, like when I'm chatting (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant_messenger">instant messaging</a>) with Madge, I don't like to move to and from the mouse just to fix my spelling mistakes.  Even with a tough word like <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=anthropomorphizing">anthropomorphizing</a>, I've developed the habit of backspacing and trying again, and again, until I spell the word correctly on my own.  I'm learning how to spell more words all the time.

In grade school I had teachers who actually discouraged the use of spell checkers because of the tendency to rely heavily on them instead of just learning the correct spelling.  However, this system of having misspelt words indicated as you type them has the subtle feature of encouraging me (at least) to want to do it right on my own (and know the proper spelling).  It also keeps me from sending off messages riddle with errors that come with typing fast (like writing "teh", "liek," and "thier").  

Microsoft Office products have gotten "smart" and auto-correct errors like these.  While easy on the user, this neither encourages people to improve their typing skills, nor teaches correct spelling, but it has the added detriment of causing people, when using non-Microsoft Office products, to type as though the machine will just fix their mistakes (even though it isn't going to).  

We hence have search engines that will give positive results for misspelled words, and a generation of people who expect the computer to make up for their own <em>laziness</em> and inattention.  Its bad enough that poor pronunciation is being accepted as "correct" in the dictionary, hopefully incorrect spelling remains incorrect.

The <em>easy</em> way <strong>isn't</strong> necessarily the <em>best</em> way.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I arrived home from San Diego on Friday, May 14, 2004.  Saturday was our 5th wedding anniversary (YAY), and Sunday we just relaxed.   But sometime either Saturday or Sunday Madge noticed that her <a href="http://pregnancy.about.com/cs/laborbasics/a/bhctx.htm">Braxton Hicks Contractions</a> were happening a bit more often and were a bit stronger.  We figured that things were getting closer but labour still hadn't started.

Monday morning at 6:30 AM Madge awoke to the uncomfortable feeling of her <a href="http://pregnancytoday.com/resource/definitions/membranes.htm">membranes rupturing</a>.  We hurriedly grabbed the hospital bags, the camera and drove off to the hospital.  The sudden and immediacy of the delivery was a bit disconcerting to Madge, but once we arrived at the hospital she managed to calm herself and we put the panic behind us.  

We didn't get stuck in Triage for forever, in fact, after a quick check (4 cm) at around 8:00 AM, I was instructed to get Madge admitted and when I returned to the 5th floor, Madge no longer occupied the triage bed where I left her.  I was quite afraid that things had progressed faster than expected and that perhaps I'd missed something important.  

The triage nurse caught my eye at the desk and told me to head off to room 524.  Madge was there with an Obstetrical Nurse and a big smile.  I soon learned that a neat set of circumstances would allow a good friend of ours, Carol, who is both an Obstetrical Nurse and a trained Midwife would be <strong>our</strong>  nurse for the day.  We were excited because we originally wanted to use Carol's midwifery services but were not in a position to pay the cost.  So, because someone on the shift had called in sick, and the hospital had called in Carol as a replacement, we were in a wonderfully surprising situation.

Carol had Madge put some street clothes back on and instructed us to go for a walk to get/keep things going.  After the walk, we climbed up and down a few flights of stairs as contractions continued to progress and intensify.  Sometime around 13:00, we both got a bit sleepy.  I ended up having a nap in a chair while Madge laid on her side and tried, unsuccessfully, to nap as well.  Suddenly I was awoken as Madge's contractions suddenly shifted gears.  It was just after 14:00 when she turned the corner and we knew the delivery would soon be here.

As the contractions intensified, so did our efforts to focus Madge and keep her from getting too panicked and noisy.  She did <strong>really</strong> well focusing on Carol's instructions as the contractions became very intense.  She managed the pain and discomfort well but certainly wished for it to be all over.

Carol checked Madge again and knew that things were close (8 cm).  She was scheduled to leave at 15:00 (when she checked) but because of the impending delivery decided to stay and see it through.  Moments later it was evident that the Doctor ought to be brought in (Carol could have done it all, but...).  

<div class="imgright"><a href="http://homepage.mac.com/dwa/index.html"><img src="http://www.skipandmadge.com/misc_baby/Sophia_small.jpg" height="269" width="202" border="0" alt="Sophia_small" /></a><br />Sophia Pictures</div>At 15:06 our second beautiful daughter was delivered.  She was cute and pink and covered in <a href="http://www.cogsci.princeton.edu/cgi-bin/webwn?stage=1&#38;word=vernix">vernix</a>.  She doesn't look like Madge, like our first daughter.  I'm quite sure that her features draw more from my side of the family, but unlike the first time, she has cute dark hair.  

The soft feet, cute toes and nose, and bright eyes melt my heart.  She has a soft little squeaky cry but quiets at the sound of my voice.  We spent some time trying to nail down the most appropriate name, and we've succeeded.  

Sophia Elle Anderson was born at 15:06, May 17, 2004.  Curiously, this date was not available on my poll, so no one was able to vote for it.  She was 6 lbs 9 oz, and 19.5 inches long.  I'm not sure what <a href="http://kidshealth.org/parent/pregnancy_newborn/pregnancy/apgar.html">Apgar score</a> she got but it was probably pretty good.

Pictures are available at <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/dwa/index.html">http://homepage.mac.com/dwa/index.html</a>.  (I will mirror them here once the initial traffic has subsided - Apple has a bigger/faster connection than I do so I'll let them do the work).]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I should really document the fun and uncomfortable parts of newborn parenthood.  Unfortunately, to properly remember the situations and exhaustion, I would want to include details that not everyone would be interested in (or want to read about).  So if I start a private blog, that none of you can read and won't even know about (except for this post), don't be offended.  

A private journal of this type will be nice because I can better keep pace with my thoughts when typing compared handwriting.  But there's also something nice about leafing through an old journal and seeing real handwriting &#8211; it tends to bring back the moment a bit better.

<div class="imgleft"><a href="http://homepage.mac.com/dwa/PhotoAlbum4.html"><img src="http://www.skipandmadge.com/misc_baby/Sophia_sleeping.jpg" height="140" width="105" border="0" alt="Sophia_sleeping" /></a><br />Sophia sleeping with Mom</div>However, I've posted another set of <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/dwa/PhotoAlbum4.html">pictures of Sophia</a>.  Things on the newborn front are improving, but life certainly isn't as stable as it used to be.  Where Lauryn simply wouldn't sleep at all (I paced, bouncing her, for hours and hours in an exhausted state), Sophia will sleep for periods longer than all the baby references we read say the time between feedings should be.  Conversely, after initial feeding troubles with Lauryn, she quickly got much better.  Sophia, however, just doesn't have enough sucking "oomph" to get the job done all the time.  But don't think that she's weak or anything...  For the short periods of time that she's awake, she's quite "howly" and kicky and is always holding her head up (for a few seconds).  

We had forgotten how frustrating little ones can be.  Not because they mean to be frustrating, but just because the exhaustion compounds with the struggles and you get weary and aren't as positive about the situation.  And then the little one will put on a cute face and or look cute while sleeping and wash all the troubles away.  I'll have to write more about the trials of teaching/surviving a newborn as I remember/encounter them.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Bedtime with Lauryn is a ritual, with <strong>no</strong> deviations.  Well, there are variations, but only Lauryn can make changes to the routine &#8211; changes that Madge and I try to avoid.  She's fallen, somewhat, into the practice of trying to stretch out teeth-brushing, story-reading, and song-singing as long as possible.  Most nights it all goes well, but there's always <strong>some</strong> sort of challenge.

Two stories, two songs, and a lullabye, then the music box and lights out.  That's the pattern.

<div class="imgright"><a href="http://www.skipandmadge.com/misc_skip/Lauryn_Dogpark.jpg" onclick="window.open('http://www.skipandmadge.com/misc_skip/Lauryn_Dogpark.jpg','popup','width=800,height=600,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=yes,left=0,top=0');return false"><img src="http://www.skipandmadge.com/misc_skip/Lauryn_Dogpark-tm.jpg" height="199" width="266" border="0" alt="Lauryn_Dogpark" /></a><br />Playing "Hole Hole" and "Bush Bush"</div>Lately, instead of me reading and singing everything, she's taken to splitting the reading tasks between the two of us.  Sometimes I need to "help," but surprisingly she does quite well.  

Naturally, at being just a couple of weeks short of 3 years, she most certainly <strong> cannot</strong> read, but in reading mostly the same 20 books over the past 2 years every night, several have been committed to memory.  

Tonight it was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0736420533/qid=1086156291/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/103-4742650-4994225?v=glance&#38;s=books">Piglet's New Friend</a>, a board book with a moveable Piglet.  The words on each page were perfectly recited, word for word, as pages were turn just at the right time (and Piglet was moved appropriately).  However, she surprised me tonight when it was time to sing.

We used to just sing regular songs.  While I was in San Diego, the ritual changed (according to her demands) so that we now sing made-up songs that are about the two songs we just read.  Tonight, as we each read one story, we each also <strong>had</strong> to sing a song.

After singing mine, and struggling to remember what we had just read about (including enough details to sufficiently satisfy her song criteria so I don't have to sing it again, better), Lauryn followed up by flopping around on her bed, reciting the entire story, word for word (except the last page).  
<div class="quote">
<h4>Piglet's New Friend</h4>
"Who do we have here?" Pooh asked, unpacking his picnic basket.
"It's a caterpillar," Piglet exclaimed.

"Maybe he'd like to try some honey," Pooh suggested.
"Careful, Pooh!" Piglet warned.  "Honey is too sticky for caterpillars."

Piglet spotted his new friend on Eeyore's lunch.
"Maybe he'd like to try some of my thistles," Eeyore offered.
"I think thistles may be too prickly for caterpillars," Piglet explained.

"Piglet, my kite's stuck!" moaned Roo.
"If I can squeeze through these bushes, maybe I can free it," said Piglet.
"Look!" said Roo.  "The caterpillar wants to help, too!"

The hungry little caterpillar began munching the green leaves.
"You've found some lunch!" Piglet said.  "Now I can have mine."
</div>
Kid's books often don't have the most compelling of stories, in my opinion, but evidently this one is worth remembering. (grin)

Also, while its been a few months since she convinced us of her ability to remember stories (and songs), I always assumed that the recollection of the exact words was keyed to the images on a specific page (or the tune of a song).  I've probably read this story to her about half the number of times that she's heard it, and while I could tell you the gist of it, I would never remember at which point the book says "Piglet warned."  Yet with no cues, her young and sponge-of-a mind has captured and can recall this funny book.  

If you're a parent, or will be a parent, or every spend time around a young child (which should include about everyone), never forget how much impact your speech and actions can have on that child.  Little "pitchers" have big ears, so don't expect them to speak or act differently than you, their example, and don't underestimate their capacity to learn and comprehend.]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I remember a day in june last year when I woke up on a saturday morning and in my foggy half-drowsed state went out to the back lawn with Lauryn to play on the grass.

I don't know what it is about the <a href="http://www.boardsofcanada.com">Boards of Canada</a>, but my memories of that day recall the wonderful melty sounds as if there was something singularIy precious in that moment and I could feel myself blissfully counting through it. . .  sixty-ten, sixty-eleven . . . 

She had her little blue knit toque on her head - perfectly matching her eyes.  Somehow for a few minutes there was nothing else but the green grass, warm morning air, the sound of robins and my beautiful little niece all cast in the shimmering glow of a soft focus living dream.

If I could memorize anything
it would be that purely perfect morning.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>The joys of two daughters</h4>

As much as I would have loved to have been writing over the past few days, well, we've been swamped.  I've had lots to write about but no time to even lay my fingers to a keyboard.

However, today I finally had time to do some much needed laundry.  (As you can see, if replenishing the pile of infant clothes moves from the "must do" list to the "free time" list, you know your priorities have shifted and that you've been rather occupied.)  I grabbed the most evident laundry, especially the ones needing scrubbing, and headed outside to our new laundry room.  (New to us of course - the washing machine is old and the dryer isn't much newer.)

As I started the washer, and separated the laundry, I soon realized that we are now subject to three color categories.  Whites, Darks, and Pinks.  

Two girls, and especially one infant daughter (4 weeks old tomorrow), generate lots of cute laundry.  Cute, <strong><em>pink</em></strong> laundry.  (Well, its cute other than the times that it has diaper-leak spots that need endless scrubbing.)  The three piles were about even in size - maybe a bit heavy on the darks, but my jeans occupy much more space than 10 burp clothes and a dozen <em>tiny</em> socks.

Pink laundry smells nice too (mostly).  Babies, up until about the age of 2, I'd say, put off a non-diaper (non-burp) odour that conveys everything cute and sweet about babies.  I swear that sometime I'm going to take a worn (but clean) sleeper and double zip-lock it so that when I'm going through the struggles of teenage girls, I can open the bag and take a whiff of newborn goodness.

And now I'm off to bed.  Goodnight.]]></content:encoded>

<title>Why Babies Should Be Born Bald</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[When our first daughter, Lauryn, was born, her thin blonde hair laid so evenly on her head that for months people thought she was bald.  Slowly the hair grew and at one point there was a patch, at the back of her head, of soft dirty-blonde hair that, if you blew on it just right, looked like a cute mustache.  

Sophia, however, was born with a fair amount of soft dark hair.  The back half of her head has longer hair than the front, but no one could claim that she's bald.  

<div class="imgright"><a href="http://www.skipandmadge.com/misc_baby/activeawake.jpg" onclick="window.open('http://www.skipandmadge.com/misc_baby/activeawake.jpg','popup','width=1152,height=596,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=yes,left=0,top=0');return false"><img src="http://www.skipandmadge.com/misc_baby/activeawake-tm.jpg" height="137" width="264" border="0" alt="activeawake" /></a><br />Playing Together</div>There's a downside to this situation, however.  Up until about two days ago, her longer hair laid flat and neat - smooth on top of her head.  When we decided that she'd probably enjoy spending some of her active-awake time laying on a blanket, we witnessed the results of Sophia's little hands discovering her own hair.

With her head turned to the right, arms stretched up above her shoulders, her left hand was perfectly positioned to touch and stroke her soft locks.  She seemed quite pleased with her discovery, but in the process of enjoying the sensation, she "backcombed" her hair into a soft fluff.  <div class="imgleft"><a href="http://www.skipandmadge.com/misc_baby/discovering_hair.jpg" onclick="window.open('http://www.skipandmadge.com/misc_baby/discovering_hair.jpg','popup','width=899,height=674,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=yes,left=0,top=0');return false"><img src="http://www.skipandmadge.com/misc_baby/discovering_hair-tm.jpg" height="199" width="266" border="0" alt="discovering_hair" /></a><br />Backcombing</div>I've been told my hair, as a child, behaved in a similar fashion (only standing on end), but in addition to perhaps a genetic predisposition, Sophia assists the process.

With touching comes grabbing, and Madge was required to intervene.  Sophia grabbed a chunk of her own fluff and pulled, making herself cry.  When the crying begins, she doesn't stop pulling and its necessary to literally pry her hand open.  At this point the crying ceases.

Funny, funny kid.  Makes herself cry and doesn't know why.

So if you wish to avoid this same situation with your children, just make sure they're born bald.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[The new camera finally gives us a chance to capture and share some of the beautiful plants and flowers that surround us here in Southern California (SoCal).

The pomegranate flowers attracted a pretty hummingbird about a month ago, and now the flowers are falling off and baby pomegranates are swelling up.  I don't know how big they'll get, but I'll definitely keep it watered.

Anyway, here's a taste of what's in our backyard and right nearby.  Click to see the <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/dwa/PhotoAlbum6.html">SoCal Flora</a>.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Sophia spent a fair amount of Sunday afternoon just hanging out being cute.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0894805770/102-3893257-7598555?v=glance">What To Expect The First Year</a> says that babies start to smile between 4 and 6 weeks after birth.  Well, Sophia is right on schedule.  <div class="imgright"><a href="http://homepage.mac.com/dwa/PhotoAlbum7.html"><img src="http://www.skipandmadge.com/misc_baby/IMG_6051-tm.jpg" height="199" width="266" border="0" alt="Half a smile" /></a><br />Click for Sunday Baby Photos</div>We shot a bunch of pictures trying to capture one of the good smiles and ended up with what we think are cute pictures.
<div class="quote"><h4>"Everybody says that my baby's smiles are 'just gas' but he looks so happy when he does it.  Couldn't they be real?"</h4>No new mother wants to believe that her baby's first smiles are the work of a passing bubble of gas, rather than of a wave of love meant especially for her.  But alas, it appears from scientific evidence so far to be true:  most babies don't smile in the true social sense before four to six weeks of age.  <br />You will be able to distinguish the first real smile from those tentative practice ones by the way the baby uses his whole face &#8211; not just his mouth.  Though babies don't smile until they're ready, they're ready faster when they're talked to, played with, and cuddled a lot.<br /><br /><em><small>from <strong>What To Expect The First Year  </strong>by Arlene Eisenbert, Heidi E. Murkoff, and Sandee E. Hathaway, B.S.N.</small></em></div>
I also took some shots of Madge and Sophia.  Other than in the hospital, Madge has been absent from almost all of the pictures (but who's keeping score, right?).  Here's a batch of <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/dwa/PhotoAlbum7.html">Sunday pictures</a>.  We hope you enjoy them.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[One of the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">best</span> worst things about having a new baby is being awake in the middle of each night.  Sophia is great compared to Lauryn, as she'll sleep from 23:00 to until about 04:30 where Lauryn would have  been awake at least once during that time period (until she was almost one if I recall correctly).

I wake up and try to assist Madge as much as possible.  This usually involves fetching Sophia, burping (sometimes) and then soothing her back to sleep and laying her down.  During the actual feeding part of the awake time, I usually talk with Madge a bit or more commonly I'll drift in and out of sleep, trying to both rest as much as possible, and be at the ready to help.

In the past I've had episodes of talking in my sleep.  Madge used to wish she had paper beside the bed to capture the funny things I'd say.  The title of this post is one of the first things I said to Madge when I was still half-asleep. Another time, at her parents' house, Madge woke me from a nap telling me dinner was ready.  My response:  "No, no, its point <strong>zero</strong>&#8211;one".

However, tonight, as I was drifting in and out of sleep, and Madge was <em>trying</em> to talk to me, my mouth decided to say things that my brain hadn't validated.  She was able to record the incident, which went something like this:
<div class="quote">Madge: You know, its taken her more than a month to get this figured out.

Skip:  Its taken her more than a month-<strong>and-a-half</strong>.

Madge:  She's not even a month-and-a-half old yet.

Skip:  Good point.

Skip:  Is that why there are more than a hundred and sixty keys?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A celebration on my cake?</div>

I cannot explain myself, and I'm certain it will happen again.

Its a good thing that Sophia is <strong>so</strong> cute (to me), otherwise I'd totally hate this.  Sleep is becoming a dear old friend that I once knew but haven't been well acquainted with for a while.  I miss it.

Oh, and then Madge makes the joke, after saying, "That was a cute baby coo,"  of, "And not C-O-U-P," that gives me visions of a gang of floppy babies, barely able to hold up their heads, trying to overthrow the government.  Things are funnier when you're exhausted.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[We had a busy day yesterday and a frustrating night the night before.  

We've never owned our own television.  We had loaners and old TVs, but were never in a position to purchase our own.  Friday night we decided it was time, and ended up at Best Buy, ready to walk out with either a Sharp 27" regular TV or a fancy Samsung HDTV.  We decided against the HDTV model because we figured HDTVs were going to improve (and come down in cost) in the near future (as confirmed by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDTV">wikipedia</a> later that night).  So we moved to the till with our chosen TV.  

Neither would they take my starter cheque for my new account (the only one with money at this point), nor a credit card imprint on that cheque.  And despite possession of a US Passport, the ultimate identification, we couldn't even get a Best Buy credit card because I don't have a state-issued drivers license.

We walked out dejected and empty handed, but unsure if the TV would have even fit in the car.  <em>Grrr</em>.

Saturday we wanted to go to the beach, but I but wanted to get a little wetsuit with built in lifejacket for Lauryn from Costco and more memory for the new camera.   After the previous night's experience I knew I had to get cash, so we packed up, made a trip to the bank, and headed over to Costco.  

After grabbing the items we had come for, we walked through the TV section and saw almost the same model TV that we'd tried to buy the night before.  This time we had the cash and were still adventuresome enough to try and fit a new TV in the front seat of our car (sans bo&#238;te, bien s&#251;r).  

So we did it.  I'm amazed that it fit (just barely) and I even took a picture to remember our craziness.  It didn't take long to drive home and drop off the TV, followed by a trip for lunch at <a href="http://www.rubios.com/">Rubio's Fresh Mexican Grill</a> for some fish tacos and chicken burrito.

Then, after being here for about three weeks, we finally made a daytime trip to the beach (<a href="http://www.sannet.gov/lifeguards/beaches/shores.shtml">La Jolla Shores</a>).  <div class="imgright"><a href="http://homepage.mac.com/dwa/PhotoAlbum8.html"><img src="http://www.skipandmadge.com/misc_skip/IMG_0020-tm.jpg" height="199" width="266" border="0" alt="IMG_0020" /></a><br />Lauryn goes to the beach</div>Lauryn was excited, but Sophia's hunger (and no reasonable place to feed her as the feedings aren't without challenges yet...) kept us from staying very long.

Lauryn and I headed down to the water's edge, leaving Madge and sleeping Sophia safely on the dry sand.  I planned on dipping our toes in the water to see if it was worth putting Lauryn in her new wetsuit, but my plans aren't always the best.

Shortly after getting our feet wet, and while looking down into the water, a larger wave (still very small) threw Lauryn off balance, plunging into the sandy surf.  I popped her up and onto her feet as quick as a flash, but the damage was done.  

<div class="imgleft"><a href="http://homepage.mac.com/dwa/PhotoAlbum9.html"><img src="http://www.skipandmadge.com/misc_baby/IMG_0045-tm.jpg" height="199" width="266" border="0" alt="IMG_0045" /></a><br />Sophia's bath</div>She was shocked, and had no idea what had happened.  Seconds later Lauryn realized that she was wet and, despite my efforts to convince her that it was fine and that the water was nice, the coolness of the situation made her want to go see Mom.  We pulled off her wet clothes, dressed her in a more appropriate fashion, and headed back to enjoy the water.  

We only spent a few more minutes before it was time to go, but the weather was beautiful, the sand was warm, and the ocean wasn't cold.  We'll definitely have to go back. 

I have two new sets of pictures available of our <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/dwa/PhotoAlbum8.html">trip to Costco and the Beach</a>, and a later set from <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/dwa/PhotoAlbum9.html">Sophia's bath</a> that night.]]></content:encoded>

I may occasionally post some of your pictures on the ward website if you don't mind.  I'm sure people would enjoy them. 

Don't have too much fun on those beautiful beaches!  We sure miss you!

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Lynne, 

The whole reason I post our adventures online (and have a website) is so that people who might not get included in a more typical mass-email can have an equal opportunity.

Post anything on <strong>our</strong> ward's website that you'd wish or point them here.  

We went to our new ward for the first time today (as a family).  It sure is different - hardly a grey (or even greying) hair in sight ? and its <strong>not</strong> because they use hair-dye either.  Its all people our age with similarly sized families.  We're sure to have a lot of fun.

But it's a transient ward and we're sure to transition back north as well.

Glad you left a comment,

Dave]]></wp:comment_content>

After going there on Saturday I totally hope that as many people come and visit as possible while we live here.  The water wasn't cold, there was lots of open breach area (even though there were a lot of people) and it was almost surreal in how NEAT it was.

Oh, and I saw one of these down by the beach too  - a <a href="http://www.ultimatecarpage.com/frame.mv?file=car.mv&num=1321">Ferrari Enzo</a> (and another slightly more common red Ferrari earlier in the day).

Come down anytime.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[The four of us moved down here to San Diego three weeks (to the day) after <a href="http://www.skipandmadge.com/archives/000045.html">Sophia was born</a>.  Things weren't going fantastic with the little one by the time we left, but the timing worked well for my employer and this adventure had to start sometime.  

I hope to document the day of travel before I forget it all, but I'd like to work back to that day a bit with this post.

Before Lauryn was born, we studied the pros/cons of nursing vs formula quite heavily.  It was a struggle to feed Lauryn at first, including a late night trip by Madge, with Mennipus' help, to the hospital because of a severe case of <a href="http://www.medela.com/NewFiles/mastitis.html">mastitis</a>.  After a few weeks, things settled down and nursing turned out to be rather convenient (not to mention the health and emotional positives for Lauryn).

We weren't going to change our routine with Sophia.  But things didn't go very well this time around.  We were able to better manage the first few days, but Sophia wouldn't latch and her electric equivalent (the proxy nurser) needed to always be at hand.  Thus the prospect of traveling only three weeks after her birth, with these complications persisting, was definitely a daunting adventure.

However, we don't often turn down a challenge, and we survived the day of travel.  Just four days later, we were weary and facing a bleak situation.

Friday night, just when things in the feeding department seemed to be turning a corner, Madge started feeling achy and feverish.  We both immediately recognized these as mastitis symptoms.  But this time we were in a foreign country, with the expectation of having health care coverage, but nothing to prove (even to ourselves) that we wouldn't be facing huge medical bills because of the infection.

So I pumped Madge as full of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibuprofen">ibuprofen</a> as I could and did my best to let her rest &#8211; hoping that somehow things could improve on their own.  They didn't.  

That night I laid, half-awake, trying to imagine how to get out of this awful situation.  "We could fly back, and just forget living here," my fatigued brain said amongst other equally unrealistic solutions.  Saturday morning Lauryn and I awoke early, and Sophia and Madge slept.  Hoping that Madge would awaken feeling better, I was rebuked by her reminder late that morning that, "These things don't <em>just</em> get better."   "I need to see a Doctor."

I went into panic mode, being forced to deal with a situation that I dreaded and that caused me much anguish.  Immediately I realized that I had <strong>no one</strong> to turn to.  The internet didn't give me any health hotline numbers to call for advice, and I didn't have time to waste.  A co-worker, Dennis, who had also moved down for the project at work, was my only hope.  I didn't know his home phone number, but luckily I'd asked him about his weekend plans, and knew that he was going to be in the office that morning.  

So I sent him an email.  I could have tried calling his extension, as its one off from my own, but I figured that if he were in the office, he'd check his email before checking his voicemail (and its permanent queue of 15 messages).  Within minutes he called.  I'm thankful for his wisdom and his assistance.  Basically he told me to forget the potential expense and get the situation taken care of &#8211; that it was foolishness to risk Madge's health.  He also volunteered to look around the office for our project manager's home phone (or cell) number and that he'd even call and find out what he could as far as my coverage was concerned (and what I should say and do).  

He left voice-mails with at least two people before getting a live body, and promptly called back saying that we should simply head to the nearest hospital, explain our symptoms (but not raise any alarms) and to be armed with our Visa card (just in case).

I knew there was a hospital around the corner (and another just on the other side of the freeway), so we packed up the kids and made our first outing: a trip to the hospital.  We were surprised that the walk-in emergency was empty.  Madge wrote her symptoms on a card, and dropped it in a box.  A triage nurse retrieved it from the other side of the wall in a few minutes, and soon she was evaluated.  Sophia slept and Lauryn ate a two-slice peanut butter and jam sandwich (the whole thing - crust and all.)

After being evaluated, and prior to seeing a doctor, payment had to be arranged.  I could remember enough from the healthcare forms I'd filled out two days prior that I was able to convince the administrator-guy that we <em>should</em> have coverage even though we'd not yet received cards.  Madge saw a doctor and our home-diagnosis was confirmed.  A simple antibiotic prescription would be sufficient and we were done.  

In the meantime, Lauryn's diaper had leaked and she'd started into her second PB&#38;J sandwich (which she later finished!).  

Based on the "Primary Care Physician" that I'd chosen (two days earlier), the Administrator-guy warned that our insurance plan might try and get out of paying for our visit because we'd gone to a hospital to which our Dr. was not affiliated!  Ugh. 

We'd survived that far only to learn that the hospital that we <em>should</em> have gone to was <strong>right next door</strong>.  Not only are there two hospitals within a 5-minute drive of each other, there are actually <strong>three</strong> within that distance. (I later discovered that the Dr. <em>is</em> affiliated with the hospital we picked, and we haven't heard anything from the insurance people yet.)

Basically things worked out well despite all my trepidation and agony.  The business nature of medical service down here <em>does</em> mean that the emergency wait is nice and short, and that the people are very friendly and accommodating (as they <strong>want</strong> your business).  But honestly, <strong>three</strong> hospitals within shouting distance seems a bit excessive.

Oh, wait, we now live in the land of excess.  I forgot for a second...]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[My friend <a href="http://www.biffard.com">Ryan</a> claims to personally know every person that shows up in a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=biffard&sourceid=firefox&start=0&start=0&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8">google search for "Biffard".</a>  After browsing the section of Ryan's site belonging to his brother, <a href="http://www.biffard.com/glen/">Glen Neil Biffard</a>, I decided to <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=glen+neil+biffard&sourceid=firefox&start=0&start=0&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8">google "Glen Neil Biffard"</a>.  At the bottom of the search page I noticed the name "Biffard" placed in close proximity to small towns near my hometown.
<div class="quote">
<a href="http://www.smflibrary.ca/communityb.html"><img alt="biffard_southernalberta.PNG" src="http://www.skipandmadge.com/misc_skip/biffard_southernalberta.PNG" width="516" height="76" border="0" /></a>
</div>
Naturally I clicked on the link and was taken to a page at the <a href="http://www.smflibrary.ca/"> Stockmen's Memorial Foundation website</a> listing "Community Families".  I don't particularly know why they have such a listing, as other than looking for a ranching family in Southern Alberta and being able to see what community area they live[d] in, you can't do much with that information.  Looking for familiar names may, however, take you into a nostalgic journey of yesteryear.  

So my curiousity was piqued and I decided to look and see what members of my family were listed on these mysterious pages.  Jumping to the <a href="http://www.smflibrary.ca/communitya.html">A page</a> I was <strong>not</strong> able to find the name of my own father, but did see listings for my grandparents (who I never knew), Anderson, Angus & Ada - Warner, and for one of my unkles and for one of his sons.  

Someone in my extended family was obviously a member of this association, so I looked at their <a href="http://www.smflibrary.ca/about.html">"About" page</a> and read this declaration 
<div class="quote">
<h4>The Stockmen's Memorial Foundation</h4>
The Stockmen?s Memorial Foundation was officially organized in 1980 by fifty founding members comprising of ranchers, farmers and individuals who wanted to commemorate the Canadian livestock industry.

The organization was incorporated as a non-profit association and was established as a foundation by an act of the Alberta legislature. It is also approved as a charitable organization by Revenue Canada.</div>

as well as the following Foundation Objectives
<div class="quote">
The objectives of the Stockmen's Memorial Foundation are:
<ul>
<li>to identify and remember the builders of the livestock industry and others who have made outstanding contributions to its progress</li>
<li>to provide historical and business information relating to the livestock industry</li>
<li>to familiarize the public with the lore of the cattle industry</li>
<li>to encourage a general appreciation of the sociological and economic significance of the livestock industry</li>
</ul>
</div>
What makes this find interesting is not as much that I have family members listed in their index, but that the farming and ranching are part of my heritage - its in my blood.

As much as I am now removed from that arduous industry, I hope to never forget my experiences and my heritage in it.  So, when I discovered that the website is actually an extension of the <a href="http://www.smflibrary.ca/library.html">The Bert Sheppard Stockmen's Foundation
Library And Archives</a> I became quite excited about travelling to Cochrane to look at some of their artifacts and archives.  I think its wonderful that such an association and library exists.  Alberta was built on ranching and oil, & the traditional ranching way of life is the base for the Calgary Stampede (regardless of the financial support of the local oil companies).

Its a little far for me to drive these days, so all you locals can go without me (& we'll go together later).  Their directions are
<div class="quote"> The Bert Sheppard Stockmen's Foundation Library And Archives is located in the Cochrane RancheHouse, 1/2 km north of Cochrane, Alberta on Highway 22. The Library is open from 9:00 am to 12:00 noon and from 1:00 pm to 4:00 pm Monday through Friday.</div>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[In French, there are two ways to refer to the amount of time we, in English, refer to as a week.  First is the straightforward "une semaine" or "one week."  However, in conversation it is more common for people to refer to a week as "huit jours" or "eight days."  Now if you count the days, from say Wednesday until and <strong>including</strong> the next Wednesday, you will count eight days.  I don't know if this is the logical origin, but if someone, on a Friday, says they'll see you in "huit jours," show up at the specified time on Friday, not Saturday.

Similarly, "quinze jours" is equivalent to two weeks (or a fortnight), and not the two-weeks-plus-one-day that you may expect.  Lauryn, however, has her own non-French, non-"English" way of counting days.  

She eats breakfast 14 times a week, and never has dinner/supper.  Each one of our days is, in Lauryn's world, comprised of breakfast, lunch, nap, breakfast and another (long) nap.  Consequently it has been very challenging to teach her the concept of "days of the week."  

However, while she knows that once it gets dark at night its time to go to bed, she <strong>doesn't</strong>  fight the afternoon nap despite the fact that its <strong>not</strong> dark.  No complaints here.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[At work, I'm working (go figure...) on some circuitry that connects to a common laptop interface &#8211; the CardBus PC Card slot.  A large portion of the connection is outside of my control, but I'm responsible to make sure that this connection is as flawless as possible.  Our competitors have connection issues that we don't want to repeat.  As such, I've spent considerable time delving into the inner details of the interface, and how operating systems (Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux) interact with and configure these components.  

I have poured over the Microsoft site trying to understand if/how I can manipulate some settings and verify my ideas.  Unfortunately, despite having heard in the past about how "Microsoft's documentation is much better than Apple's", I have never found a concise guide to how the operating system (and developers) can interact with CardBus hardware, or how to write a device driver on the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/">Microsoft</a> <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/default.mspx">sites</a>.  

I have found tidbits that containing complex information making reference to concepts left unexplained and surprisingly devoid of links.  The picture in my mind is far from clear and the amount of clarifying work seems insurmountable.

So I started to look into the Linux code and documentation for the same devices and concepts.  Unfortunately, my dual-boot Windows/Linux work laptop doesn't like to talk to the work email server under Linux, so I can't really spend all day booted into Linux, though its documentation seems a bit more friendly.  

My personal laptop, however, gives me the best of both worlds and more.  I can access useful and detailed documentation that clearly explains the process for doing what I want to do, <strong>and</strong> I can send and receive email all day long without suffering any of the limitations that my Linux install gives me.

The Apple documentation is strongly oriented towards bringing people into the Apple development community whereas <strong>all</strong> the Microsoft documentation that I've read makes <em><strong>huge</strong></em> assumptions about my existing understanding.  If I should happen to google into an Apple document that's a little too coarse, it <strong>always</strong> contains a link to other higher-level documentation better suited to my situation.

I feel that this is (yet another) example of the ideological difference between Apple and Microsoft.  Both companies are interested, at the lowest level, in making money, but the way they cater to their users, and in this case developers, is completely different.  

Looking at this solely from the software development point of view, Microsoft assumes you've been part of "their team" for years &#8211; that you've taken their training courses and have an intimate knowledge of the old and new styles of working with Windows.  Obscure references to undefined acronyms and concepts is commonplace.  Links to pages that seem to have no relation to the subject at hand are all that exist, and there's no sight of a "how-to" or self-explanatory morsel of sample code in sight.  

The windows source code is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_source">closed</a>, and its as though they don't want to give anyone but their paying developers any insight for free (ie. they want you to pay to get your questions answered and your hand held through the process).

Apple, however, has the core of Mac OS X (and many other software pieces) available for <strong>anyone</strong> to <a href="http://www.apple.com/opensource/"></a>browse and learn from.  This <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source">Open Source</a> policy is great for someone like me in a situation like me.  I'm independent and willing to inform myself if the materials are available.

If I want to see how Mac OS X initializes and configures CardBus devices, I can simply read the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/darwin/">Darwin</a> code.  If I'm curious about some function I see used in some sample code, I can read exactly how its defined and implemented.  And, as I said earlier, the Apple documentation is oriented completely towards bringing new developers on board (from either the ground up or from other platforms).

It was trivial to find a sample driver for what I'm interested in, and its completely free for me to download the Mac development tools.  All I invest is my time, and its not a frustrating learning process.

This quote, from the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/GS_Darwin/index.html">Getting Started With Darwin</a> page, sums up Apple's stance succinctly. 
<div class="quote">The Darwin layers of Mac OS X are open source. This serves two main purposes: to provide a resource for other open source development efforts (such as Linux and BSD variants) to make their software available on Mac hardware and to provide source code to aid developers writing device drivers and other low-level technologies for Mac OS X.</div>

Find me a "Getting Started with Windows XP Development" page on microsoft.com or other information that provides this same opportunity, and I'll print and eat these very words.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I ran into a <a href="http://www.apple.com/webobjects/getting_started.html">Trial Version</a> of Apple's <a href="http://www.apple.com/webobjects/">WebObjects</a> on their Apple Developer Connection site.  Its good for 30 days and if I work at it I could seriously evaluate the possibility of using WO for an idea I have.  

Unfortunately, after installing the demo, none of the WO developer applications would launch.  The <a href="http://www.apple.com/webobjects/getting_started.html">WebObjects Getting Started page</a>  said that the trial was for Mac OS X 10.2.2, but the installer key I received says its good until October 1, 2004.  Panther (OS X 10.3) is the latest version of the operating system, so I figured it should be forwards compatible, but it isn't.  A quick peek at the system.log using the Console program in /Applications/Utilities showed that

<span style="font-size: 11px; font-family: monospace;">/Developer/Applications/EOModeler.app/Contents/MacOS/EOModeler can't open library: /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/PBXRemoteClient.framework/Versions/A/PBXRemoteClient  (No such file or directory, errno = 2)</span>

A quick search for <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=PBXRemoteClient.framework&#38;ie=UTF-8&#38;oe=UTF-8">PBXRemoteClient.framework</a> lead to this page describing <a href="http://www.objectstyle.org/woproject/wolips.html">How to enable support for the old PB.project of WO 5.2.2 under Panther with Xcode</a>

It turns out that the framework being sought has been updated and renamed.  Using a symbolic link (like an alias or shortcut) to create an old framework that is pointing to the new framework is sufficient (thusfar) for enabling WO 5.2 under Mac OS X 10.3.4 Panther.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[This morning I spent a few minutes moving my <strong>old</strong> weblog posts into this one by hand.  It didn't take too long and now they are all accessible via the <strong>monthly archives</strong> on the main page.  Anything older than November 2003 is old content that is new as of today.  Because of the poor quality of blogging software available at the time, making regular posts was too arduous and I only kept up the practice for a short stint.  Two months in my first stint, and one month on my second attempt.  Its a notable coincidence that my first entry every was July 15, 2002 and the first entry for my second stint was July 14, 2003.    There must be something about Madge's birthday (July 14) that causes me to want to express myself in writing.  

This stint has been much longer (November 2003 to present) and I'll totally attribute this to the ease of posting and maintaining a site using my current combination of <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/">MovableType</a> and <a href="http://www.kung-foo.tv/ecto/">ecto</a>.  I do think however, that I'm going to give <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> a test run in the near future and if it works nicely I'll move the whole site over from MT (as I'm not going to upgrade to 3.0).

Of note, the previous blogging package I used include <a href="http://radio.userland.com/">Radio Userland</a> (which I only used for one day and I <strong>totally</strong> didn't understand why I would want to post to a common site.  It was a bad experience), <a href="http://www.blosxom.com/">Blosxom</a> (which converted simple .txt files into html using a browse-time .cgi.  It was ok but not very scalable or fun after the first, well, two months), and <a href="http://www.lifli.com/Products/iBlog/main.htm">iBlog</a> (which dumbed down the experience too much, had a wacky interface, hid the posts under crazy urls and just felt too micky-mouse-ish.  Its features didn't work and it was incredibly rough).  MovableType has been good for me thusfar, but its always nice to improve as well.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I love the Tour de France.  I think its an amazing example of endurance, teamwork, technology, competition and strategy.  Mainstream sport (Basketball, Baseball, Football) have a collection of plays and minimal plans, but usually the only time during a game that these can be seen as valuable is during the closing minutes of a close and important game.  

Cycling can have its critical moment at any time during the race.  If you stretch this race over 24 days, and each day has between 2 and 6 hours of riding, that's a lot of exciting moments for 200 riders on narrow, traffic-circled, people-lined roads.  Flat tires, crashes, mountain climbs, sprints, time-trials, rain, drunken spectators on critical stages, and scorching heat.  Yes, there's no tackling, punching, chair-throwing, mound-charging, helmet-throwing action, but the strategy, multiple jerseys to be won, and constant potential for upset is just what I crave.

This year was Lance's chance to win six Tours in six years, and to become the first man to do that.  I think he's a great rider and a great strategist and he's helped form and mold his team into an almost perfect engine for propelling him to the win.  Other riders are great as well.  Last year it was <a href="http://www.vinokourovnet.tk/">Vinokourov</a> and <a href="http://www.fact-index.com/j/jo/joseba_beloki.html">Beloki</a> that provided excitement.  <a href="http://www.janullrich.de/">Ullrich</a> was good to watch as well, winning second only 61 seconds behind Armstrong.  

This year it was <a href="http://www.tylerhamilton.com/">Tyler Hamilton</a> (and his early exit), Andr&#233;as Kloden, Ivan Basso, and young Thomas Voeckler.  The Basques from <a href="http://www.fundacioneuskadi.com/">Euskaltel - Euskadi</a> didn't provide any excitement on the mountain stages, but a small yellow wristband was all the rage on and off the race-course.  14 out of 20 stage winners wore them and, as of the day after the Tour finished, eight million other people around the world.  

The day after Lance won the Alp d'Huez time-trial, I remembered to order a couple from the <a href="http://www.laf.org/">Lance Armstrong Foundation</a>.  <div class="imgright"><a href="http://www.skipandmadge.com/misc_skip/IMG_0015.JPG" onclick="window.open('http://www.skipandmadge.com/misc_skip/IMG_0015.JPG','popup','width=1254,height=938,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=yes,left=0,top=0');return false"><img src="http://www.skipandmadge.com/misc_skip/IMG_0015-tm.jpg" height="198" width="264" border="0" alt="livestrong" /></a></div>They only sell them in packs of 10, 100 or 1000, so I ignored the "backordered" status and ordered 10.  Yesterday they arrived.  The website still says they are backordered, but evidently they're shipping them as soon as they receive more.  And as this yellow emblem can be seen regularly on TV (John Kerry), and around town here in San Diego, they must still be a very hot item.  

I think this is a pretty neat trend that I'm glad to be a part of, however.  The proceeds from each $1 wristband go to the<a href="http://www.laf.org/about/"> Lance Armstrong Foundation</a> to support young people diagnosed with cancer through education, advocacy, public health and research.  The goal of the WearYellow campaign was $5 million dollars.  If 8 million people were wearing them three weeks ago, that number has probably doubled by now.  Its amazing to think that a simple band of Made-in-China silicone could become so popular &#8211; that giving to charity could become so fashionable and highly recognizable.

Who's wearing yellow near you?]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Many people have told us how amazing the <a href="http://www.sandiegozoo.org/">San Diego Zoo</a> is and how its one of those things you just have to visit when you come down here.  Thursday we went with Dama and Tapa to check out this famous zoo.

Madge and Lauryn and I got year-long memberships that gave us two free passes.  We used these passes on Dama and Tapa, and entered the zoo with no idea where to go.  We also received a two 2-for-1 discounts on the bus-tour of the zoo.  It is such a large zoo that to see the entire zoo in one visit would be nearly impossible.  (At least, if you wanted to really see things and not just run past them all.)  We forked over a few more bucks and took at 35 minute bus ride through the park.  It generally gave use a sense of what animals were found where, and what parts we'd want to visit on foot.  The tour was good.  The section of the zoo dealing with hoofed animals was quite packed with nice displays of endangered and extinct-in-the-wild animals.  

<div class="imgright"><a href="http://www.skipandmadge.com/photos/sd_zoo/"><img src="http://www.skipandmadge.com/misc_skip/IMG_0033-tm.jpg" height="198" width="264" border="0" alt="IMG_0033" title="african elephant" /></a><br />Click the elephant for more Zoo pictures</div>The tour finished by the elephants, rhinos, and pygmy hippo, close to a caf&#233; and right at lunch time.  The marine layer had lasted for an unusually long time that day, keeping us shaded and cool until just when we finished eating.  Sophia was hungry, so we checked out snakes and tortoises while she ate.  A huge albino python (white and yellow), a copper-head rattle snake, and a cobra were some of my favorites.  The snake exhibit, right next to the Children's Zoo was horribly crowded and I was always unsure as to whether Lauryn really could see the snakes or if she just wanted to look through the next window.  For all the trouble it was to get her a good view, it was hard when she'd just lean over (in my arms) and try to see the next one.

Back together we wandered past the apes, skipped the crowded gorillas, and walked down an amazing hillside full of exhibits and authentic foliage.  One thing that definitely makes the San Diego Zoo special (and probably quite unique) is that the natural landscape and climate (when you add lots of water) allows you to recreate tropical forests, grow bamboo, and have beautiful outdoor exhibits that should be comfortable for the animals and that are a pleasure for people to see.  The exhibits are often built so that cages and metal fences either aren't visible or needed.  Seeing the beautiful tiger on his sloped, lush, grassed habitat was a real treat. 

After the hippo, the heat and fatigue set in and we made our way back to the entrance.  Lauryn must have enjoyed herself, as she promptly fell asleep, her head lolling in her carseat.  We'll have to go back to see the Pandas and Polar Bears.

Photos from our adventure can be <a href="http://www.skipandmadge.com/photos/sd_zoo/">seen here</a>.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I'm very much a proponent of optimization.  This isn't to say that I do everything in the most optimal fashion, but mundane tasks that I find inefficient or backwards really drive me bonkers.  In such a situation, my mind has a tendency to focus on this inefficiency until I can propose a proper solution (or until I find one).  I'm sure it drives Madge crazy at times because I can suddenly get refocused on something that isn't relevant to the important tasks at hand, but that I have an almost uncontrollable desire to fix.  If I'm unable to remedy the situation, I'll usually avoid the inefficiency until I have time and can dedicate some time and make it right.  

Up until a few days ago I didn't have what I thought was a proper method of posting galleries of pictures.  Weblog software (MoveableType and ecto) have allowed me to easily write my thoughts and events, and include single images in posts, but to shoot a digital roll of pictures and post them quickly and easily, in a page format that I can specify and tweak/customize effectively has been out of my reach.

<a href="http://www.apple.com/ilife/iphoto/">iPhoto</a> is a very good tool for capturing, organizing, viewing and performing basic editing on photos.  However, outputting a roll of images onto web pages limits you to its hard-coded styles, organization and structure.  To customize the look of the output I would have to edit every page by had.  Computers are tools, but only if you can harness that power.  There is no reason that I should have to make the same changes to each page every time I want to post pictures (and still be limited).  

Someone else evidently felt the same, and came up with an iPhoto Export plugin, <a href="http://www.droolingcat.com/software/betterhtmlexport/">BetterHTMLExport</a>, which allows you to specify a template for the thumbnails and for each image page.  I grabbed a <a href="http://www.droolingcat.com/software/betterhtmlexport/exchange/view_template.php?uid=41">decent template</a> and then set to customizing it.  My biggest addition was to take the javascript that Ryan uses to create a slide show effect, and add it to the template.  

The <a href="http://www.skipandmadge.com/photos/july2004/">SeaWorld pictures</a> and <a href="http://www.skipandmadge.com/photos/sd_zoo/">Zoo pictures</a> both used this template.  You can lazily browse all the pictures in each set by clicking on the first thumbnail picture and then clicking on "Start Slide Show".  Sit back and the images will switch every six seconds, but you can speed up, slow down, or pause/resume the slideshow as well.

I'll still probably make some changes to the template, but for now its an acceptable solution.  If you want the template that I'm using, just leave a comment (with valid email address) and I'll contact you.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Lauryn and I went for a walk on Friday.  Right next to our apartment is the beginnings of a long valley.  She and I enjoy strolling down the dusty path, throwing rocks and asking each other questions about what we see.  Sometimes we climb up the steep side of the valley to the community playground.  This time, we just kept walking.  

Mostly we didn't see anything but airplanes, helicopters, a butterfly, growing bamboo, and last of all, a cute little lizard.  We had been watching for lizards, but the sweltering heat of the valley must be too much for even lizards, as we found this little fellow in the shade of the bushes growing in the runoff of the sprinkler system above the valley.  I quickly halted Lauryn and pointed toward this small shape that mostly looked like a funny rock or stick.  <div class="imgright"><a href="http://www.skipandmadge.com/photos/desert_beach/"><img src="http://www.skipandmadge.com/misc_skip/IMG_0090-tm.jpg" height="199" width="266" border="0" alt="IMG_0090" title="Little Lizard" /></a><br />Little Lizard</div>She did spot him and I faced a barrage of questions as I quickly tried to zoom in a take a picture of him.  I'm very glad that our digital camera (Canon S1IS) has a 10X optical zoom, as in combination with some additional digital zoom, I was able to get a reasonably clean picture.  

He scurried off into the brush as we turned and headed back up the valley, turning off and climbing the steep valley wall to the playground.  Lauryn played on the swings as I took a few photos of the nearby flowers.  After lots of swinging, I convinced her that it would be OK to go look for a cactus that I saw on my epic bike ride.  I marched off through the brush in a different direction with her on my shoulders.  Soon we were back in the blazing sun, surrounded by tinder-dry bushes.  A few steps more and I found a cute cactus, seemingly growing straight out of the rock.  After a few pictures for my memory, it was time to head back home for lunch.  Lauryn had enjoyed reaching down and grabbing the drinking tube for the water-bladder in my backpack, but I was getting hungry.  

After lunch and naps, we decided that this would be a good day to go to the beach at Del Mar.  The six of us piled into the Grey Grandma again and we drove out through the Torrey Pine State Park, through the quaint center of Del Mar and managed to find a spot to park a block from the beach.  We marched off to the sand, the marine layer in the sky and sea breeze in our faces.  I  suspected that it was too late in the day and that the water would be too cold for Lauryn and I to enjoy.  

<div class="imgleft"><a href="http://www.skipandmadge.com/photos/desert_beach/"><img src="http://www.skipandmadge.com/misc_skip/IMG_0115-tm.jpg" height="354" width="266" border="0" alt="IMG_0115" title="Lauryn and Daddy" /></a><br />Lauryn and Daddy</div>Quickly we prepared ourselves and headed for the surf.  I wanted Lauryn to feel comfortable in the water, but she was a little anxious so I held her and kept her from getting soaked.  Surprisingly, the water was quite nice, but the action of the waves was a bit scary for my little girl.  I'd dip her feet and waist in the water after every wave and she enjoyed it for a while, but, too soon for my wishes, she wanted to head back to the sand and be with Mommy.  She was quite content thereafter to sit, playing in the sand and watching the surf, people and birds.

Fortunately this was then my opportunity to enjoy the ocean.  Lauyrn and I have played with our Boogie Board in the pool many a time, but it had not yet been used in the Pacific.  I hurriedly grabbed it and ran off into the surf, excited at the prospect of being able to experience the free-flowing movement that body-boarding, surfing, snow-boarding, and water-skiing allow.  

Quickly I realized that I had completely forgotten, since the last time I played in the Ocean when Madge and I went to France, how the sea was incredibly salty and how the waves truly never cease.  Very soon I managed to catch a couple of small waves and was quite enthralled with the experience.  My only complaint was that I had not put in my contact lenses, didn't want to risk losing my glasses, and could then only enjoy the activity from my myopic point of view.  My family on the beach was nothing more than coloured, expressionless pillars.  

Still it was fun.  But, until either someone else visits and can ease some of the struggle that taking a newborn to the beach entails, or we build up our courage and try to do it on our own, I'll have to ignore our proximity to such merriment and remain satisfied just enjoying the wonderful weather and my beautiful, giggly girls and wife.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I'm pretty bummed out about the NBC Olympics coverage.  Day after day we turn on the coverage and I'm completely convinced that there are only three events in the Olympics &#8211; Swimming, Gymnastics and the National Anthem.  The coverage is too disproportionate for my tastes, and I definitely like to see more than 3 minutes of cycling, rowing, judo or boxing for every 10 minutes they spend showing the flag raising and national anthem four times a night.  I don't care if I only see US athletes, I just want to see more than an obligatory morsel of sport to justify playing that song, in its entirety, <strong>again</strong>.

Tonight, instead of even turning on the TV, I'm going to bed.

Even home grown Americans <a href="http://www.able2know.com/forums/a2k-post776869.html#776869">feel as</a> <a href="http://www.able2know.com/forums/a2k-post780793.html#780793"> I do</a>.]]></content:encoded>

<title>Glen&#039;s Canadian Olympic Team Thoughts</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.biffard.com">Ryan's</a> brother <a href="http://www.biffard.com/glen/">Glen</a> made a fairly large post the other day that I quite enjoyed.  Glen's site is fantastic but he doesn't (yet) have any archives so once he changes his page anything he's written is lost.  So I'm just going to quote his entire post here for archival purposes.

<div class="quote">
Aug 22/04: 
[snip]
<strong> Olympic Thought:</strong>
 Well now on to the Olympics. I hate to say it but I have been very disappointed in our Canadian team. One week of competition and only four medals. For the size of the team we have sent that's not very good. I was thinking this was going to be our break-out year with well over 20 medals. It looks like I am wrong. Amateur sport in Canada needs a real shake down. In their interviews, all the athletes are saying. &#8220;I gave it all I had but it didn't work for me [this day].&#8221; The ones who where going to be our big guns have all chocked. It's like they can't deal with the pressure. Now don't get me wrong - to make it to the Olympics is unbelievable. You must be an extraordinary athlete just to qualify. I just think that with the size of team we sent we should be doing 'way better in the medal count. I talked to my friends Sukhpaul, Rossco and BJ about this and we have come to the same conclusions.

 Sukh believes that we need to build more training centers for our athletes. Every major city should have some sort of major sports complex with all the bells and whistles. I am with him on this. Not only would these state of the art training centers give our up-and-coming athletes a chance to train in the best sports complexes in the world, it would also get many of your top athletes together to train and compete with the very best. There are a few spin off to all of this. First, it would give the youth in the country the chance to watch their idols train. This could keep them more interested in their sports instead of more interested in their video games. Second, if we have the best training facilities in the world then we will attract athletes from other countries to come and train right here in Canada . Many times when the CBS is introducing the athletes on the starting line, they say this guy is from Poland but trains in the US or this guy is from Croatia and trains in the US . Well, if we had state of the art facilities we might get more athletes from abroad coming to Canada to train. If athletes from all over the globe come to Canada to train then it will push our athletes to be even better. A great example of a major sports complex is in Calgary . Since the '88 Olympics, Calgary has been turning out some very good athletes who wouldn't have been as good if it wasn't for the facilities they have there.

 The second problem is we need better coaching. I think BJ came up with this as well. The coaching at the top level in Canada is great. The problem is with our youth development system. Now over the years, I have seen this problem, on a small scale with the Central Okanagan Youth Soccer Association. For those of you who don't know how soccer works in the in the Central Okanagan , here it is in a nut shell. At the top we have the select program, from which teams compete for top honors in the province every year. Then the system works its way down to gold and then silver. 

What the Central Okanagan Youth Soccer Association has done is they have hired a head coach (Andrew Letham) for the whole system. He goes around to all the teams' different practices and runs them for a night. So what you have is one head coach for all of the central Okanagan (that's like 10,000 kids) going around and running one or maybe two team's practices every night. So Andrew runs about 5-10 practices a week. Then, after he runs a practice he won't see the kids for at least a month, and maybe not even for the rest of the season. This to me is not very efficient. With 10,000 kids in the system and Andrew moving through one or maybe two practices a night, he is seeing about 35 kids a day who he might not see again for the rest of the season. Well what are these kids going to learn from this guy once a year? 

If you want the kids to learn team play and positioning then they would need him to show up every night. It takes a team many years of training to get these concepts down. The second thing is that after this guy comes in with his British accent and fancy drills, the kids then lose some respect for their real coach. So after Andrew leaves, the kids think they have seen the good times and won't be as responsive to the real coach. This is not good. 

Well I have had an idea for a few years. When I coached in the Central Okanagan Select program, I suggested it to the people who ran the show, but nothing ever came of it. I know from experience, both as a player and coach, that having Andrew coming into practices once a year, it is almost more destructive than positive. What he needs to do is classroom sessions with the coaches. In the classroom, he can show the coaches everything from strategy and positioning, to conditioning and healthy eating. He could use power point video and white boards to teach these parents-turned-coaches how to coach. 

All you would need to do is group the different coaches together for these class room sessions. Say Mondays is Select coaches from U-15 up then Tuesday is gold coaches from U-15 up etc etc. This way you could group the different levels of teams together and have different level classroom sessions for each. Then the coaches can bring up different game scenarios and as a group they would be able to come up with solutions to the problems that might arise. With this, Andrew would be able to get involved with every team's practice without even going to the field. So, instead of working with 35 kids a night he can work with much bigger groups. Now what does this all have to do with the Olympics? Well let me tell you. It shows how the youth of Canada aren't getting the best possible coaching they could get. For the most part, the youth coaches out there, are parents who don't really know enough about the sports their kids are playing. If you could educate these parents we would be able to bring better athletes through the different systems across Canada . First off if you have better coaches then they will give a higher knowledge level to our younger athletes. If our young athletes know more about their sport, they will be 'way better off in the long run. 

The most successful youth teams have a very dedicated and energetic coach who has a thorough knowledge of the sport he or she is teaching to the kids. With this knowledge and energy the kids maintain and high level of interest. With more kids staying in sports comes more competition. With more competition, kids will push themselves more. If they get pushed more they will not only excel to a higher level but will also be able to deal with the pressure of getting pushed or the pressure of a major event. This can only help them in the long run. This is why we need better coaching for the youth of Canada .

 The last major problem we came up with is the need for more awareness of all Olympic sports. Now I ask you - How often do you watch swimming, track, rowing, or amateur boxing ? Well, if you are anything like me your answer would be every four years at the Olympics and maybe a bit during the Pan Am or Commonwealth Games. My second question is this. When are these sports even on TV? The answer is Sports Sunday on the CBC. That's every Sunday afternoon. Now who wants to be watching TV on a Sunday afternoon? Well not me that's for sure. Ok last question. When do you even watch the CBC? Well, for me it is every Saturday night in the winter for Hockey Night in Canada . Then maybe once a year for a Sunday night movie. So instead of playing those stupid sitcoms about a retired cop in the Arctic , they should show some sports on prime time TV. 

That's right - show some amateur sports during the evening mid week. I know I would watch. It's not like anybody watches those dumb shows about a farmer from Saskatchewan who moves to Toronto anyway. It would probably be a lot cheaper to send a few announcers and a camera to an event somewhere than pay for a crew to make a sitcom that nobody watches. With the CBC there is a section of their web page that is ask CBC. You can go there and ask them about their programming and make comments on it. So I urge you to go there and tell them to air more sports in better time slots. Here is the link you can go to <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/askcbc/">www.cbc.ca/askcbc/</a> 

Now the second thing is, we have 2 major sports networks in Canada.  One is TSN the other is Sportsnet. These stations are "Sports Networks." To their credit, they do show lots of pro sports like hockey and baseball. But where are the amateur sports? I have never ever seen track, rowing, gymnastics, amateur boxing, or swimming on these networks. You get more WWF and dog shows on TSN. Or "You Gotta See This", and Fishing with Shelley &#38; Courtney on Sportsnet. Are these shows even sports? How is a dog show a sport? Or how is some drunk hick who rolled his 4x4 and miraculously survived, a sport? Not only are these things not sports, these networks are showing them. Even the web pages for these Sports networks have nothing on amateur sports. They have all the professional leagues but nothing on amateur sports. For example it took me 30 min of searching the web to try to find out how Malindi ran in Zurich and London . So awareness in Canada is nonexistent and you have the major TV networks to blame for that one. If you would show these sports when people are actually at home watching TV then maybe we would know a lot more about them.

 People need to realize how much an athlete with Canadian colours can bring together a country. Whenever I watch a Canadian athlete wearing the Canadian colours, I get all excited and start to cheer them on. The pride and nationalism felt by Canadians when Canada wins a sporting event, is huge. Like today when Kyle Shewfelt won gold for the men's floor exercise in artistic gymnastics I was like &#8220;Yeah Canada !&#8221; Then, when they played &#8220;O Canada,&#8221; I got goose bumps and was very proud to be Canadian. I had never even heard of this guy when I woke up this morning. But now I am like he is the man and Canada is the country . Look at the past and how the morale of Canada elevated a few notches after we beat the Americans for gold in Olympic hockey. In Kelowna it was mid Feb and people where all painted up running around the streets like chickens with their heads cut off. You couldn't even drive through the downtown streets and that's in Kelowna ! That was two years ago and people still talk about it. People still talk about '72. When ever I hear the words, "There's a shot - Henderson takes a wild stab at it. There another shot - Henderson scores!" I get goose bumps and I wasn't even alive. But I am like yeah Canada is the Best. So, all I hope is that after the Olympics, Sport Canada takes a long hard look at the problems we are facing and fixes them at the roots instead of putting a bandage on a gushing wound.

 If anyone has anything else to say on this please email me and I will put up your views up on the web page next week. Feel free to criticize my thoughts or add to them. Just send me an email glen_biffard@yahoo.ca Also I urge you again to go to <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/askcbc/">www.cbc.ca/askcbc/</a> and tell them your thoughts on the CBCs programming.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[A townhouse across the street from us is for sale.  I'll list the specs, and you guess the price.

<ul><li>Bedrooms: 3</li><li>Baths: 2.5</li><li>Est. Sq. Ft.: 1264</li><li>Stories: 2</li><li>Garage: 2 car, attached</li><li>Pool: Community</li><li>Jacuzzi:  Community</li><li>Rec. Room: Community</li><li>Tennis Courts:  Community</li><li>Heat: Radiant (Ceiling)</li><li>Cooling: Room A/C in Living Rm. &#38; Mstr. BR</li><li>Patio: Enclosed</li><li>Deck: Off Mstr. BR (over Garage)</li><li>Recent Upgrades (past 2 years)</li><ul><li>Dishwasher, Disposal, Microwave, Range/Oven</lii><li>Carpet</li><li>Kitchen Cabinets</li><li>Tile Floors</li><li>Granite Countertops</li></ul></ul>

This 30 year old townhome, complete with recent termite fumigation, can be yours (or ours I suppose) for the amazing low price of only

<strong>$519,000 USD</strong>

What an incredible steal of a deal!  Oh, but I forgot that on top of the mortgage payments every month for the next 30 years, there's an additional $250/month Home Owners Association fee to cover the Common Area Maintenance, Exterior Building Maintenance, Insurance, Sewer, Trash Pickup, and Water.  Over the course of 30 years, at the static price of $250/month, that's $90,000 USD

So, using these figures, the present value of the dollar, and ignoring leap years, that's $55.62 USD/day.  I've stayed in a motel in Nevada and a Hotel in France for less than that a night.  However, the interest of a mortgage usually costs at least as much as the principle, so that doubles the daily cost to ~$110 USD/day for the next 30 years.

For 1200 square feet, a 15' x 12', concrete patio, and a rather small 2 car garage?  Nah, not for me.  If I really loved debt that much, I'd buy a similarly priced monstrous house in a high end part of Calgary and get a much better value for my dollar.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Its been a busy two or three weeks, and I'm a bit worn out.  Many things have I had to say, and longed to express, but nary a moment existed for me to inscribe them.  Work, though enjoyable and satisfying, has been ceaselessly hectic.  Its crunch time, with people required to work over the previous two weekends to meet the deadlines.  This next weekend we will be voyaging to the Switzerland of the Americas&#8482; and from there I shall be semi-circumnavigating the world to spend two weeks in China.  I don't expect to enjoy the pleasures of visiting foreign lands, as I'm prescribed to support manufacturing efforts, meaning I may not see the sun and scarcely my pillow.

I gain peace through expression, and have many thoughts and ideas bottled up.  The rigours of two children, despite the much improved situation of Madge and Sophia (thankfully), and a demanding work schedule, have left me ill-at-ease.  Hopefully I can dedicate the time necessary to resolve the disparity between thought and expression.

Children are a sacrifice, in ways I simply never imagined.  Two children cause sacrifices that can be avoided with but one.  Small things like showers, eating, shaving, cleaning, laundry and sleeping go by the wayside, let alone time for expression, creativity, planning, and recovering from the asperity of the day.  Yet still they are wonderful and darling, smart and cuddly, needing and grateful.  Many things could I spend my time on, but <em>they</em> deserve my time and I'm usually glad to devote it.  It seems a rule in life that nothing good comes without hard work, sacrifice, and devotion.  I shall follow this then, with faith that the results merit the effort and more.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[The other day as I made my walk home from work, a fluttering green rock caught my eye from a spot where my foot was about to go.  I quickly halted and with disbelief recognized this shimmer of green to be an injured <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hummingbird">hummingbird</a>.  One wing failed to flutter like its mate, and my stomach sank as I realized this beautiful creature was in a very vulnerable and probably fatal position.  I curiously looked up for the cause of the injury and found the beautifully mirrored windows of the fancy pharmaceutical company staring ominously back at me.  I did not want to touch this little hummer, lest my smell and presence cause more grief, yet I couldn't leave it helplessly fluttering.  

I searched my bag for a suitable scooping device, and ended up using an enveloped CD to carefully lift this tiny body from its concrete doom.  At first I thought perhaps I could place it near some flowers, where it could eat a bit and wait for me to inform myself at home and return.  This wouldn't have worked at all, I decided, and I carefully headed home, porting this thumb-sized body on a polycarbonate platter.   As I made the rest of the 5 minute journey home, I was amazed at the calmness of my long-beaked friend.  It did not stir or try to flee.  I'd like to think that it could sense my compassion, but I'm certain it was quite exhausted and weary unto death.  

Ignoring Madge's quizzical looks as I entered our apartment, I headed for the patio and a suitable container for my famished cargo.  Placing it in a clear aquarium-like box, I googled for the sugar-water recipe with which I could hopefully nourish this poor <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna%27s_hummingbird">Anna's Hummingbird</a>.  <a href="http://www.projectwildlife.org/index.html">Project Wildlife</a> has a page devoted to helping people who have <a href="http://www.projectwildlife.org/find-hummingbirds.htm">found hummingbirds</a>.  
Amazingly this top search hit is also located in San Diego, not far from Old Town and Sea World.  

I quickly mixed the 1 part sugar to 4 parts water "nectar" and claimed Sophia's 1-milliliter liquid syringe as a feeding apparatus.  Filling it 0.7 mL full, I quietly took Lauryn with me outside in the hopes of helping my little bird.  It did not even startle as I brought my hand close and placed the tip of the syringe around its slender beak.  <div class="imgright"><a href="http://www.skipandmadge.com/photos/the_hummer/"><img src="http://www.skipandmadge.com/misc_skip/IMG_0058-tm.jpg" height="189" width="264" border="0" alt="IMG_0058" /></a><br />Feeding my Hummer</div>At first it did nothing, but as I removed the syringe, the tiny mouth opened and a tongue made furtive licks.  Soon after enveloping half the beak a second time, I noticed a tiny flutter inside the syringe as the hummer's tongue quickly slurped the energy-rich drink.  Hummingbirds must feed very often to keep their fast metabolisms running (every 30 minutes I believe - except at night).  I hoped that the window-strike had not happened long before my arrival on the scene, but I was excited that my attempts to assist and feed were finding success.  

About 0.5 mL of sugar-water were consumed in that session.  Every half hour thereafter until around 10:00 I continued to offer more nourishment.  Madge called the Project Wildlife hotline and learned a few more hints, and what we should do if the fragile life should make it through the night.  We didn't want it to get cold, so we brought it inside, and around midnight I tried to feed it again but was mostly refused.  At 6:00 I was awoken by Sophia, so I used those moments of awakedness to offer a morning drink.  It was still a rather sleepy bird I guess, as at first it didn't respond to the syringe, but moments later it fluttered to life, startling me and then commenced to drink close to another half a mL.  The Project Wildlife shelter didn't open until 9:00, so I stayed home from work, helped to get Lauryn ready to go with me, and then drove down and dropped off my Hummer after our rather short "test drive." 

Lauryn thought the tiny bird was "so cute," and hoped that it would "feel better and get bigger."   She was also a bit sad that we wouldn't be returning later to pick up "our" healthy bird.  She wanted to keep taking care of it, but we've had our hands full enough with Sophia without having to feed a cute bird like this every half hour.  I gave a $5 donation to the wildlife rescue organization, sufficient to buy food for close to a dozen hummingbirds I think, and we made our way home.  

We've seen these beautiful creatures flitting by from time to time, and it was a rare treat to see one up close.  Rarer still was the chance to help and hopefully save such a tiny, shimmering green body and gossamer wings.  I doubt we'll get a "status update" from the busy volunteers, but I'm glad that such a society exists to help something as seemingly insignificant as a hummingbird.  Its fairly easy to get wrapped up in the duties and cares of our material world, and I'm grateful to have been raised with enough caring sensitivity to do all I could to assist the best kind of Hummer.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[So this morning I have the fortune of flying for who knows how many hours (14?  18?) to Hong Kong for work.  I'll try to post some of my adventures here but I don't know<ol><li>what time I'll have available - usually on trips like these I work 16 hour days</li><li>what internet access is available and where</li><li>what websites China filters and if I'll even have access to my own site</li></ol>Luckily, however, we were able to go out into the cold yesterday and take our traditional fall family  pictures with <a href="http://biffard.com/">Ryan</a>.  It was just above freezing, fairly humid, and windy, and the kids got cold pretty quickly.  <div class="imgright"><a href="http://www.skipandmadge.com/misc_skip/IMG_0001.JPG" onclick="window.open('http://www.skipandmadge.com/misc_skip/IMG_0001.JPG','popup','width=800,height=600,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=yes,left=0,top=0');return false"><img src="http://www.skipandmadge.com/misc_skip/IMG_0001-tm.jpg" height="199" width="266" border="0" alt="IMG_0001" /></a><br />My Plane to Vancouver</div>Ryan snapped off 90 pictures in just a few minutes and I'm pretty sure we got at least a couple of good ones.  I'm not ready to post any at this minute though, as I'm currently awaiting my flight to Vancouver.  Luckily the YYC airport has free Telus <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wifi">WiFi</a> at the moment.  I wish/hope it would stay free forever, but naturally they'll want to hook travelers like me with a "the first hit is free" scenario and then charge a lutt-boad (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoonerism">spoonerism</a>) once they have enough addicts.

Well, my plane just pulled up, so I'd better grab some spare food from Tim Horton's and walk around while I have the chance.

I'm definitely going to miss Madge and my two cute girls.  Lauryn is pretty sad that I've been gone.  In San Diego when I leave for work she always says, "But I dust wanted you to stay."  And that's just when I'm gone during the day and come home at lunch.  Now I've been with her non-stop for a week and I'll be gone cold turkey.  At least Dama and Tapa will be with her yots while I'm away.

A plus, tout le monde!]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Better Learning Through Experimentation

So I've been in China for a week today and this is the <strong>FIRST</strong> opportunity I've had to write anything about my experience.  I've had (and have) lots to say, but I'll not start at the beginning (unfortunately). I must share what's on my mind today before it escapes me.

I work as an Electrical (Hardware) Engineer dealing with mostly digital circuitry, including <a href="http://www.pcmcia.org/papers/cardbus.htm">CardBus</a> (PCMCIA), and USB signaling, mixed with a touch of Power Supplies, Processors, and associated circuitry.  University is great for teaching you the mathematical details of how/why stuff works and ways to optimize and improve things, but its very shy on non-programming, non-logical problem-solving training.  That is, its great for teaching you how to reason through a problem or theory and find a solution, but doesn't bless you with good soldering skills.

Now, some people come to University from Technical Schools (Colleges) and have actually taken courses that teach you the hows and why's of mixing solder, flux, heat, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printed_circuit_board">PCBs</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printed_circuit_board">Printed Circuit Boards</a>).  But people who've only done the math-heavy (heavy-math?) Bachelors/Masters/Doctorate programs don't stand a chance when it comes to a 60/30 Sn/Pb (Tin/Lead) mix and how to work with it effectively. 

Luckily, I'm the son of a farmer.

 I grew up experimentally teaching myself how to do what I'd seen only others do.  Soldering would be no different.

I learned to use an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welding">Oxy-Acetylene</a> torch by watching my brother melt rocks (turning the surface glassy) in the best vise I've ever seen.  Only a few exploded, and I was never harmed as much as the time the woodstove blew up (which only melted my eyebrows and eyelashes &#8211; but that's another story...).  

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manual_metal_arc_welding">Arc Welding</a> was a skill I developed out of necessity, with my brother-like nephew Chad and I pooling our knowledge to figure out the basics.  I was rather afraid the first time I even turned on the welder, and that fear quickly turned into frustration as I struggled to stop sticking the welding rod to my injured Go-Kart and create an arc instead.  We also struggled with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_inert_gas_welding">MIG welder</a> from time to time.

So when I first worked for my current employer (this is the third time), I was rather intrigued by how all those little parts were stuffed onto such an intricate board.  Oh, how much deeper I've now gone <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice%27s_Adventures_in_Wonderland">down into this rabbit hole</a>.

On my second stint, I was given opportunity to debug some of these rather complicated collections of fiberglass, copper, gold, and ceramic elements fused into function with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solder">solder</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flux_%28metallurgy%29">flux</a>.  Soon I had a part that needed replacing - the biggest part on the board.  I decided, in keeping I suppose with my previous history, to try to do that which others around me were doing.  I removed the part without too much fuss, but before a new part could be placed (which I'd let someone else do), the solder tailings needed to be removed.  I didn't understand the incredible value of each board or the huge risk that was inherent in what I was trying to do before I started, but I was game to try.

At this time, unfortunately, we only had 13 of these early prototype boards, and only three worked even minimally.  That number quickly dropped to 12 when, in my ignorance, I left the vital flux out of the equation, and tore one of the signal pads off the PCB.  

New to the job, and lacking prior experience, I was ashamed to have so badly failed in my job of <em>fixing</em> boards.  The graduates of the "lesser" technical schools are the gods of product development.  The engineers can reason and understand the nuances of what's needs to be done, but the techs are the ones that make it happen.  Without them, we'd be stuck playing with our models, schematics, and ideas.  But that which I find intriguing is that which I wish to understand and master, and so I vowed to learn by experimentation and study by observation the skills and techniques of my solder-savvy coworkers so that I would never so recklessly "bone" a board again.

I've spent a couple of years since that time endlessly trying to improve my skills, not to compete or replace my tech mentors, but to not be so dependent on them that I can't fix failing circuitry when they're not around to <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">school me</span>  save my butt.  Today I find myself in that very situation, and my hard earned skills have been heavily taxed.  Jared and Satnam, things would have progressed much faster today if you'd have been around.  But I'm far away in China, and I don't trust one of the locals to do the work the way I need it done.  The language barrier, at its best, is just too great.

I'm working on fixing part of the design that is completely new to me.  I understand the system-level operation of this section of our design, but I'm not trained in the component or inner workings, yet the situation demands my time, and so once more I learn by experimentation.  Additionally, the specific components I'm trying to make work aren't simple surface mount parts, they're rather delicate <a href="http://www.st.com/stonline/prodpres/dedicate/wireless/technolo/bcc.htm">Bump Chip Carrier Packages</a> whose proper connection is sensitive and integral to the proper operation of our product.

My investigation involves removing and reseating some of these parts to determine the root cause of some failure's we're seeing.  I've been nominated to be the one to attempt to do the work of my tech mentors.  Its fairly important, and I've done the job before, but the exact scenario is new.  Not only do I need to make the board work, but I must try to do so without using fresh parts, and be as methodical and precise in the order and details of the problem-solving routine as possible.  Its an intense blend of engineering analysis, logical-proof, and technical skill.  And its all done from behind a microscope using tools that almost all too imprecise for this meticulous work.  At least I brought my own tweezers.

I spent five consecutive hours looking through eyepieces, alternately wielding a heat gun, a soldering iron, Q-Tips, tweasers, a toothbrush from the hotel, isopropyl alcohol, solder, and flux in an attempt to produce perfect results.  My actions somehow drew a crowd, and for the first two hours I had an ever changing group of up to 5 or 6 Chinese workers peering over my shoulders, watching my every move and tool swap.  They chatted to each other in a language I can't understand about my actions and intentions most probably, but also, at times, the foreign colour of my hair, and well, I don't know what else.  

Regardless, I'm a somewhat self-conscious person when I'm doing such demanding and sensitive work at the best of times, let alone when I'm being crowded from behind and inundated with noisy jibber jabber.  A stressful situation with the additional stress of foreign observation and discussion was taxing on both mind and body.  I cannot yet trust my results, so I'll try to repeat the process tomorrow on a second board before making any conclusions.  

Hopefully I can be ignored by those around me, as I work faster when I'm "on my own" and in a groove.  I also hope my efforts bear fruit (figuratively of course), the big unknown behind this problem is frustrating and I'm running out of time.

Its intimidating to be in such a challenging and important situation, but its both what I've been trained (and employed) to do and I suppose what I'm skilled at doing, and I quite relish the opportunity to make a positive impact with my precise efforts.  The potential reward of succeeding is what motivates me to do my very best &#8211; despite the 16 hour days.  Still, I'm glad I only travel (and work) like this about once a year.   I'll be happy to be home, where I can hold Lauryn and Sophia in my arms, and feel Madge's embrace once more.]]></content:encoded>

Hard Labor, manditory escorts, minimal free time and no release on your own recognizance, not to mention nightmarish bathroom experiences, stomach rumblings and exclaimations of gastric revolt, language barriers, scrutiny, fatigue, and the feeling of being torn away from every familiar place and routine.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[While we were able to take our traditional fall photos while we were in Calgary (which I haven't posted yet), this last Saturday we took a rather impromptu to the fancy part of La Jolla.  <div class="imgright"><object classid="clsid:02BF25D5-8C17-4B23-BC80-D3488ABDDC6B" width="200" height="150" codebase="http://www.apple.com/qtactivex/qtplugin.cab"><param name="src" value="http://www.skipandmadge.com/movies/l_seq_sm_tiny.mov" /><param name="autoplay" value="true" /><param name="controller" value="false" href="http://www.skipandmadge.com/photos/la_jolla_oct_2004/" /><embed src="http://www.skipandmadge.com/movies/l_seq_sm_tiny.mov" width="200" height="150" autoplay="true" controller="false" pluginspage="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/" href="http://www.skipandmadge.com/photos/la_jolla_oct_2004/"></embed></object><br />click the movie to see the photos<br /> or here for a <a href="http://www.skipandmadge.com/movies/l_seq_lg_high.mov">larger movie</a></div>Lauryn was able to get her toes sandy and Sophia cooperated very nicely.  It was a nice relaxing afternoon &#8211; almost like being on vacation except it was only a 10 minute drive away.  We ate outside some little sandwich shop and took turns looking at all the shops.  It wasn't overly busy as we were able to find a parking spot on the street in front of the beach.  We even saw a Mom and two kids riding <a href="http://www.segway.com/segway/">Segway HTs</a>.  

Its definitely a sign that things are going better when its Madge's idea to get out of the house and go do something adventuresome.  I've gotten so used to it not even being a possibility that weekend outings haven't even been on my mind.  

Sophia is quite enjoying drinking formula from a bottle.  In fact, Madge thinks that I feed her too much!  

Its really great to see her so happy, though.  Definitely a different baby than when I went away to China.  She's always been cute, but now she's a bit plumper, and so happy now that she doesn't really cry &#8211; she just sings and calls, even when she's hungry and just woke up.

Today she's been chomping her gums and drooling more again, so perhaps the little white enamel will start poking through.  The cheeks aren't burning red and her bottom isn't rashy yet, so it still might be a ways off.  At least Lauryn is excited for her to have teeth.  (It just means that she'll be able to feed her.)

Glad to see everyone looking so happy!  Sophia sure is getting big and Lauryn is just as pretty as ever.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
Unfortunately my employer has required me to once again come to Southeast China.  I've not yet posted my comments from my first visit two months ago, but I'll say a few things now while I have the chance.
</p><p>
I'm just a bit too big for airplane seats.  If I sit with my legs stretched out straight, my shins are forced into the back-bottom edge of the seat in front of me, and the front of my seat cuts into the tops of my legs (right beneath my butt) enough to make my butt and legs go numb.  On a short flight I can handle it, but when the flight takes 15 hours, its awful.  I also like isle seats as its always easy to jump up and stretch your long and numb legs, or, as I did on the way over here, jump up and head to the bathroom in the middle of some good turbulence. 
</p><p>
No, I wasn't sick.  I wanted to head to the lavatory in the middle of the movie so I wouldn't be trapped in a lineup with everyone else on the plane the moment the show ended.  The seatbelt sign <em>was</em> on, but the turbulence <em>had</em> been very mild.  That was until I closed the folding door behind me.  I had to put my hands in front of my head and try to keep it from hitting any one of the four surrounding walls.  I came quite close, the less, of cracking my skull on the door.  At least the lavatory was small enough that I didn't have to worry about falling off (though I almost experienced periods of weightlessness.
</p><p>
Traveling from the Hong Kong airport to Kowloon and then up into mainland China wasn't intimidating this time, and having been here once before, I'm not experiencing the culture-shock I did last time either.  The traffic here in the city of Dong Guan is still very crazy, and there's always lots of people on the streets, but I've learned to appreciate the benefits of blending in.  
</p><p>
Last time I had no trouble, but for some reason this time the beggars are attracted to me like vultures to a wildebeest carcass.  Since living in France I've always considered myself fairly aware of my surroundings, especially what the people close at hand are doing.  I think, however, that I've been very desensitized by the fact that <em>everyone</em><strong> </strong>here stares at me and I ignore the feeling of their eyes on me.  The fact that there's always so much that's completely foreign to me, that I examine more intently than the people around me doesn't help either.  (Plus, like I said, there's just always tons of people on the street - yes, even <em>on </em> the street.)
</p><p>
Nothing really dramatic has happened, but I have been chased down the street by an old beggar trying to shove his bowl in front of me.  I've been around panhandlers, street-drunks, and rude beggars before, but never around any <em>so persistent.  </em>The few encounters have made me grateful of the constant companionship of our hosts.  I would really love to just walk around on my own, but being tall (to them), with dirty-blonde hair, and fair skin, I'm just a "rich american" target.  Ugh.
</p><p>
The food hasn't shocked me as much this time either.  But surprisingly I've had <em>very</em> little appetite.  Last time, the food was completely new to me and I was hungry and ate well.  This time I often know what we're going to have, but I'm just not hungry.  
</p><p>
I've tried a few more "crazy" dishes too.  Last time we had shark, goat, deer, bird (not chicken) and some good fish, but this time I've tried jellyfish, eel, and, well, tonight's dinner.
</p><p>
I had a bad food experience in France several years ago.  It deserves its own account, but lets just say that I'm not a fan of tripe.  Well, tonight my traveling companion Denny and I felt like "light" food - like noodles and broth.  So that's the kind of restaurant we went to.  It was a small place the driver knew about &#8211; a very common-person restaurant where a bowl of soup and noodles cost around 5 RMB ($0.75 USD).  The menu naturally had no pictures or english and lots of options.  I picked a beef and mein noodle combo that had a "thumbs-up" beside it.  I hoped the thumbs-up would mean that I would enjoy it, but my palate doesn't match a chinese palate yet, so I was unsure.
</p><p>
The bowl arrived and the first thing I noticed was the unmistakable surface of tripe.  It didn't smell too bad, and if it is prepared ok it should be ok, right?  Plus, I figured I'd just eat the noodles and leave the "flavour agents" behind.  I dug in and it was pretty good &#8211; for the first few bites.  
</p><p>
Soon I noticed some other odd organ meat.  I think it may have been lung or maybe kidney.  I couldn't remember from my days of high school biology what the cell structure was, but it was familiar.  The hosts couldn't identify it either.
</p><p>
And then I noticed <em>the</em> smell.  
</p><p>
At first it was just a bit faint &#8211; something I could ignore.  The others noticed that I was having more trouble than they, but it must have been an expression on my face or the way I chewed the noodles endlessly, because I really thought I was doing well, eating large mouthfuls of noodles.  But the the smell seemed to grow stronger and attacked at my memory.  
</p><p>
My gut wrenched involuntarily, and I tried to <em>not</em> figure out my history with the smell.  I still haven't associated any particular experience with it, but I would best describe it as being very similar to ammonia.  Ammonia mixed with cow stomach/tripe, and a hint of something else.  
</p><p>
Needless to say, as I leaned over my bowl to take a mouthful of noodles, I was forced to hold my breath to even take a bite.  I tried to continue, but my body told me no, and I wasn't about to disagree.  I've learned that sometimes you just have to listen to your <em>gut </em> instincts (hee hee).
</p><p>
The others asked if I wanted to order something different, but I was neither very hungry, nor ready to expose my stomach to something different but equally difficult to consume (or anything for that matter).  I still feel some tummy rumbles, and I hope that's as bad as it gets.  
</p><p>
Last night we went to a common-person Hot Pot restaurant that only serves goat meat.  I don't mind goat, but again, I wasn't very hungry.  I ate a reasonable amount and had an OK time, but Denny must have been too hasty in eating some of the meat cooked in the boiling pot, as he was up half the night, paying for his meal.
</p><p>
So it <em>is</em> a rather unique experience coming here.  Hopefully I don't catch anything from the food, the beggars or just some dirty door knob.  The situation easily puts me at risk, but that's part of the fun, isn't it?

Being a world apart from my family right now, I consider myself lucky to remain relatively abreast of the current family events.  However this means that my information may be a bit lacking in accuracy, as the time shift an odd hours of communication, make things a bit fuzzy.

That said, I'd like to give our (Skip and Madge's) warm congratulations to my niece Angie and her husband Mike on the birth of a beautiful little girl.  I think she was born Friday night and was 6 lbs, 3 oz.
</p><p>
Her aunts (no uncles at all???) and grandparents are thrilled and excited I'm sure.  We wish you all the best and hope that Mom and Baby will be and stay healthy and happy (and that Dad will be able to get enough sleep).  
</p><p>
If you send me more pics, I'll do my best to post them.
</p><p>
<strong>[UPDATE] </strong> Mike and Angie have decided on the name of Brylie Jaye Wynes.  She was born December 3, 2004 at 9:26 pm and was 19.5 inches long.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I'd like to publicly apologize for some inappropriate content on this site.?Ç¬? It was not content that I published or would even let exist on this site (had I known it was there).?Ç¬? It was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog_spam">comment spam</a>, and while I was in China the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bot">bots</a> (usually compromised Windows machines) had fun filling up the comments to my posts with vulgarities and links intended to boost their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank">google page rank</a>. 

You may have noticed that the look and feel of the site has changed as well.?Ç¬? The reason for the change was the comment spam, as the original weblog software I was using (<a href="http://movabletype.org/">MovableType</a> 2.6) was created before comment spam was a real problem.?Ç¬? Add-ons were developed to fight the spam, but MT 2.6 became outdated and I had no motivation to move to version 3.0.?Ç¬? The more attractive solution to me was to migrate from MT to <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>.?Ç¬? I've done a couple other WP installs for others, and its generally a much slicker approach to blogging than MovableType.?Ç¬? MovableType had a <strong>huge</strong> following, and many nice plugins, but with version 3.0 came a licensing change and hoards of people shied away to other solutions.?Ç¬? WordPress looks to have some good momentum behind it, and hopefully the plugin creators keep making <a href="http://wiki.wordpress.org/Plugin" target="_blank">slick plugins</a>, as I'd rather not have to switch platforms again.

The layout and appearance is from the <a href="http://binarybonsai.com/kubrick/" target="_blank">Kubrick project</a>, but I intend to make modifications.?Ç¬? If things appear wacky for a day its probably because I'm trying out something new.?Ç¬? I've grabbed two comment spam plugins (as comment spam bots exist for WordPress too), that should work together to keep it easy for people to comment, but keep the nasty trash off this site.

So feel free to safely peruse the archives without fear of you (or your children) running into something you'd wish didn't exist on the internet, and please let me know if you should ever find something.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[One of the tools which has allowed me to blog as often as I have has been <a href="http://ecto.kung-foo.tv/" target="_blank">ecto</a>.?Ç¬? Recently updated to version two, its only gotten better.?Ç¬? I haven't tried out the <a href="http://ranchero.com/marsedit/" target="_blank">MarsEdit</a> competition, but I did buy a license to ecto, so unless MarsEdit blows ecto away, I probably won't be switching until economics enters the picture again.

Evidently WordPress (the site software that makes this happen) didn't play nicely with ecto, but it was all WP's fault.?Ç¬? Today I found this <a href="http://mycvs.org/archives/2004/08/22/combined-xml-rpc-patch-for-wordpress-12-and-ecto/" target="_blank">patch for Wordpress 1.2 and Ecto (or MarsEdit)</a> that apparently enables the following:
<ul><li>Categories</li><li>File upload</li><li>Some date magic</li><li>Ecto will again be able to get the URL of a post</li><li>The Markdown plugin will be seen by ecto</li><li>Trackbacks will work</li></ul>So if you'd like to try some nice Mac (or Windows) desktop blogging software, be sure to give <a href="http://ecto.kung-foo.tv/" target="_blank">ecto</a> a try.]]></content:encoded>

<title>Too Much Meat and Noise Pollution</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[[Note: I wrote this at the start and end of my first trip to China.?Ç¬? I've recently completed my second trip, but didn't post this until I had a chance to go through all the photos I took.]


<div class="imgright"><a href="http://www.skipandmadge.com/photos/china_sept_2004/index.html"><img src="http://skipandmadge.com/misc_skip/IMG_0102-2-tm.jpg" height="310" width="233" border="0" hspace="4" vspace="4" /></a><br />Click the photo to see more</div>
After the first 24 hours of being in China, all I can say is <strong>too much meat</strong>.?Ç¬? They're probably trying to show us hospitality, but I'm really not used to eating so much meat.?Ç¬? I am actually a bit afraid of mealtime, because it just means that I'm going to be expected to eat a bunch more meat.?Ç¬? I would have expected much more rice, but it seems like for most meals there isn't <em>any</em> rice.
But anyway, here's a better play by play of what I've experienced thus-far.

We rode the train north from Hong Kong to Dong Guan.?Ç¬? The train didn't seem to get moving until we had left HK and gotten into China.?Ç¬? Clusters of housing complexes (like apartment buildings but what remind me strongly of the socialized housing "projects" in France - the ZUP or Bats) floated past the train window, mingled with "farmland".?Ç¬? Topless farmers could be seen tending their little spots of land, and it was clear that farming here (from what I've seen) is 100% physical labour.

I didn't actually have the time to finish writing this back when I started.?Ç¬? I'm now on the flight home and, well, its been quite an experience. 

Dong Guan is what I'd describe as a "rural city."?Ç¬? Its big, has a large population, but its completely lacking in most modern amenities.?Ç¬? No brand name anything exists.?Ç¬? No "regular" shopping, or anything similar.?Ç¬? The hotel was adequate, but had its own quirks as well.?Ç¬? The only purchases I made in Dong Guan were DVDs from the "DVD Store."?Ç¬? Like everything in China (it seems), they're knock-offs.?Ç¬?  As I was told one day, the people of Dong Guan aren't concerned with brand name, if its cheap and it works, then they're satisfied.

Getting off the train was like being in any other train station, except that we needed to go through Chinese Immigration and Customs.?Ç¬? My visa was in order and soon we were outside, looking for our ride.?Ç¬? The factory provided a van and driver, to pick us up and take us wherever we needed to go.?Ç¬? One of my coworkers had been here before, and he recognized the van/driver and we loaded up and headed off to the hotel.?Ç¬? I soon realized the wisdom in being driven by what I'd consider a professional driver.

Traffic in China is <em>anything</em> but what I expected.?Ç¬? I always considered Communist countries to be heavily regimented and organized.?Ç¬? But, given that I saw <strong>no visible evidence</strong> of Communism, I suppose it shouldn't surprise me that traffic is anything but organized.?Ç¬? The larger roads have stop lights, complete with count-down timers, but the lights seem sometimes to be considered only a suggestion.?Ç¬? There's an incredible system of communication between drivers, consisting of different lengths and patterns of honking.?Ç¬? Its very noise and most mornings it was not my alarm that woke me, but the incessant and loud honking (despite being on the 18th floor).?Ç¬? However, the most shocking element of traversing the city was the seeming lack of care for human life.

It was more common to see motorcyclists riding with their helmets hanging from their handlebars than on their heads.?Ç¬? It was also very common to see more than two people on a motorcycle.?Ç¬? Three and four is quite common (sometimes with baggage as well).?Ç¬? Families, complete with tiny children would ride, with children sandwiched between parents or sitting in front of the driver, holding the mirrors for stability.?Ç¬? Cargo, from caged chickens, to barrels of ???, are also commonly transported by motorcycle, and they also seem to be the most common type of taxi.?Ç¬? I just don't understand how ladies, in dresses, can balance while ride side-saddle on the back of a motorcycle, especially in that chaotic traffic.

Chaotic doesn't begin to describe it.?Ç¬? Vehicles of all types, mix with pedestrians, at any and all points along the road.?Ç¬? I've been passed on the left, by a city bus who had crossed the yellow line into oncoming traffic, with another bus coming head-on.?Ç¬? Pedestrians play frogger with their lives, inching across the road from lane-divider to lane-divider.?Ç¬? They don't even flinch or hurry or anything.?Ç¬? They walk, the drivers honk and dodge them, but they're also dodging bicycles, scooters, motorbikes, tricycles, and tractor/rototiller carts?Ç¬? (take a rototiller and an add a small truck box and then gun it down the road).

Somehow it all works out surprisingly well.?Ç¬? Brake pad manufacturers must make a killing, but there's surprisingly few accidents.?Ç¬? Even so, a good driver makes all the difference.?Ç¬? It a crazy blend of quick reflexes, agressiveness, and sharp defensiveness that makes it work.?Ç¬? Intersections are completely uncontrolled usually, and whoever gets in the way first is the one that gets through.?Ç¬? Though they race toward the intersection, somehow the drivers mentally communicate or are defensive enough to understand who they will and won't let go through.?Ç¬? Somehow the factory drivers can weave they're way through better than the others.

The only enviable part about this traffic scenario, is how none of the drivers get stressed or angry or concerned about the situation.?Ç¬? The honking is notification and negotiation, not a symbol of anger or protest (mild protesting sometimes, but rarely).?Ç¬? I guess they're just used to it.

I shot some video of the traffic, hopefully I got some good moments that demonstrate the adventure that occurred each time we climbed into the van.?Ç¬? Oh, and no-one wears seat belts.?Ç¬? The back seats of the van didn't actually have any.?Ç¬? You're therefore completely at the mercy of the driver and the other vehicles.?Ç¬? And yes, there were some close moments, but all you can do is trust the driver.

The factory was good, for the most part.?Ç¬? We sleuthed out some issues and I had to make a trip to Hong Kong and back with the top factory official.?Ç¬? That experience will be a story all its own.

Mostly I worked between 16 and about 18 hours a day.?Ç¬? I was rarely at my computer with its horribly slow connection, and spent all my time trying to pick out the biggest problem and come up with a solution.?Ç¬? I've already written about one of the days, the others were very similar.

The thing about this factory trip that was new to me, was their intense security.?Ç¬? Entering and leaving the factory often involves registering laptops, and not being allowed to have cameras, but we also had to have an escort at all times.?Ç¬? We sometimes dodged this rule, but also were chastised for doing so.?Ç¬? In fact, other than the short time we were at the hotel, we had a escort of one type or another at <strong>all times</strong>.?Ç¬? Moving between floors, or going around the office required an escort.?Ç¬? Worst of all, the usually trivial task of going to the restroom also required an escort.?Ç¬? I seriously felt like I can now identify (mildly) with prison inmates who have to request permission.?Ç¬? It made it really hard to <em>take care of business</em> some days.

The people were hard working and contentious, so much so that often while I was experimenting or when I'd leave something where they obviously didn't think it belonged, it would get spontaneously cleaned up and disappear.?Ç¬? It was nice to see but really quite a bother.

The language barrier was also a big headache for me.?Ç¬? There were about 5 individuals who spoke reasonable english.?Ç¬? There were an additional two I think who spoke and understand a bit, and beyond that, they didn't speak or understand any.?Ç¬? Consequently I became, or tried to become, good at pantomiming what I needed, but this type of communication just didn't work effectively sometimes, leaving us both confused, frustrated or both.

And other than the first couple of days, I really enjoyed the food.?Ç¬? There was still a large amount of meat consumed, and a shocking lack of rice, but the meals were varied and flavourful and unique.?Ç¬? Fear-factor has nothing on me now.?Ç¬? I ate most everything, though sometimes only a few bites.?Ç¬? Spicy food was more enjoyable to me than the others, and I soon became known for liking spicy stuff.?Ç¬? Somehow I could trust the spicy stuff to match my palate (beyond just the heat), and once they knew I liked it, at least one dish would be selected specifically for me.

The hot peppers were good, but I went a bit overboard one night.?Ç¬? It was pretty hot and since that evening my stomach, and the continuation of my digestive tract, have been a bit out of whack.?Ç¬? I don't honestly know if it was the peppers, or the large amount of hot oil that I consumed that night, or even the quality of the food and the poor cleanliness at that particular restaurant.?Ç¬? Either way, I've managed and haven't felt poorly, but I need to stay aware of the location of restrooms and make use of them fairly often.

The plant manager, who I travelled to Hong Kong and back with, occasionally shared a meal with us.?Ç¬? He spoke english very well, and loved to pick unique restaurants so he could expose us to as many different types of traditional food as possible.?Ç¬? His choices were wonderful and it was particularly special to receive the explanation of the origin, history, and significance of each dish.

China is incredible.?Ç¬? From the more modern cities to the rural, dusy, dirty, noisy places like Dong Guan, there's an incredible amount of potential and talent.?Ç¬? No one was overweight, and few men were even heavy.?Ç¬? Many people were walking or biking, and though they live in rather third-world conditions, they seem happy and friendly ?¢?Ç¨?Äú content and appreciative.?Ç¬? There was no talk of politics, no evidence of the Chairman or Communism.?Ç¬? There was a healthy (well, substantial) number of guards, peace officers, and police (if there's a difference), but no other symbols of regime or oppression.?Ç¬? I consider myself lucky to have been able to visit a country so rich in culture so different from the American and European cultures that I know.?Ç¬? Its so rich in history and tradition, and I'm glad I've been there before the Olympics arrives.?Ç¬? I don't know for certain that China will change by itself, but I'm certain it will become a more popular destination and those consequences are unavoidable.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I met a woman in the Hong Kong airport on the way back from China.?Ç¬? When I first saw her I had to caution myself not to stereotypically judge her or "look down" at her because of her appearance.?Ç¬? She is a human being, a person equal to myself, though her physical size is something that I personally would not want to sit beside on a 11-15 hour flight over the Pacific.?Ç¬? She was pushing a stroller and carrying a couple of the bags that are a necessity when traveling with children.?Ç¬? Though perhaps a bit burdened by her situation, she otherwise didn't look very different from the other weary travelers congregated around the gate.?Ç¬? Having flown several times with both one and two small children, I certainly didn't envy her position.

When I stood to get in line to board the plane, she was immediately in front of me in line, and, evidently more weary than I initially judged, commented, "We have to show them our passports, again??Ç¬? We couldn't get <em>this</em> far without showing them already."

I looked down, saw a 2 year old Chinese toddler in this 35-year-old caucasian woman's stroller, and asked, "Have you travelled with her before??Ç¬? Does she travel well at least?"

She responded, her hands full of passports, tickets, and bags, by saying, "No, I just came over here to pick her up."

Suddenly I was overwhelmed by the courage and charity of this poor woman.?Ç¬? I've done many things for my two girls, but I would be cautious about flying half way around the world with them at this age, let alone traveling by myself to a foreign country to pick up an orphan child and immediately begin caring for them as my own.?Ç¬? I was simply amazed by the love and devotion of this wonderful woman for the otherwise destitute child she rescued.?Ç¬? It takes a lot to be a parent, and for a mother to give birth to a child.?Ç¬? It also takes a lot, though differently perhaps, for a person or couple to adopt and love a child as their own, not to mention one who doesn't speak your language or come from your culture.?Ç¬? Though the scenarios are rather incomparable in many ways, they still require the commitment of a lot of devotion, time, and love.

I offered my assistance ?¢?Ç¨?Äú what little I could ?¢?Ç¨?Äú but she declined and I wished her the best.?Ç¬? As I took my seat, I thought more about her probable situation back in Georgia.?Ç¬? I cannot accurately draw my own conclusion about the family lifestyle this child will grow up in, but I hope for the best and assume that anything this woman can provide will definitely be better than the state-run orphanage in mainland "communist" China.?Ç¬? So many possibilities are now open to this tiny little girl that didn't exist a day or two before.?Ç¬? Its simply amazing when you step back and think of it.

But I ask these questions of you, the reader, and I'm curious about if/when your answer will change from "Yes" to "No".?Ç¬? Feel free to sound-off in the comments.

<ol><li>Do you agree, with me, that it is wonderful of this woman to adopt a poor Chinese orphan, and give her love, hope, and a place for her to fulfill her potential?</li><li>If this woman is married, though I doubt it, isn't it wonderful that this child will go from being parent-less to having two role models and caregivers, and the support structure to possibly allow one parent to raise her and the other to provide financial support?</li><li>If the child's new mother is single and employed, isn't it better that this daughter spend days in day care but at least has a loving mother to go home with?</li><li>If the mother is single, but has a relative who lives with or near her and can help love and raise this little girl, isn't that still better than the alternative life as just another orphan in the land of 1.3 billion people?</li><li>What if the mother was single, but lived with another woman who she considered her partner for life, wouldn't that be better still than having no parents and no future?</li><li>What if the union of these two women was legally recognized by the government, would the child still be better off, with these two individuals filling the role of parent, than the alternative of living without <em>any</em> family in a third world country?</li></ol>
[Note: My questions should show the kind of family organization I would prefer this child to be raised in, but hopefully they also provide a thought provoking <em>perspective</em> that I doubt many people have considered before.?Ç¬? Traveling to foreign lands always makes me appreciate the things I have that others do not.?Ç¬? It can put a new spin on old perspectives I think, but only if you look beyond your own situation.  Tolerance does not equal advocacy.] ]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I've done no less than 5 separate Wordpress installs, and each one has worked flawlessly... that is, except for this one.

If you've visited anytime in say, <strong>the last month</strong>, you will probably have been shocked to see just 1995-style text.?Ç¬? No colours, borders, nice fonts, nada.?Ç¬? For the first couple of weeks of wackiness, I tried a few things to fix the problem.?Ç¬? I could fix it momentarily, but soon the links to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stylesheet">css stylesheet</a>, which nicely converts boring text to flashy layout, would become broken.?Ç¬? 

Finally today I gave up, <a href="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2004/06/20/wordpress-12-one-click-backup/">backed up my install</a>, deleted the database, and then restored just the content (and none of the potentially messed up settings).?Ç¬? I've also switched to a lemony theme.?Ç¬? I'll definitely modify it, but its a start.

Welcome back to the 21st century.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[We have the sweetest neighbour here in San Diego.?Ç¬? "Grandma Lee" recently turned 95 and lives all alone next door.?Ç¬? Her son is estranged and she hasn't heard from him in years, and her daughter lives in Colorado.

Like many of the elderly people I've lived around, she's a rather independent soul even at such a frail age.?Ç¬? We used to see her shuffle past our door and drive off in her car to get groceries or head to the bank,?Ç¬? but recently her car hasn't moved from its parking spot.?Ç¬? Just before her birthday, she asked Madge to take her to the DMV so that she could renew her driver's license.?Ç¬? She managed to pass the test and could drive her car, but since receiving her new license, I think she's moved her car only one time ?¢?Ç¨?Äú she says the battery is dead.

No one visits her.?Ç¬? No one came for Christmas.?Ç¬? Since her car wasn't working, Madge has intercepted her, with the help of Lauryn, as she tried to walk to either the bank or grocery store ?¢?Ç¨?Äú neither of which is reasonably close for someone of her age.?Ç¬? In fact, her bank is more than a mile away and on the other side of a deep valley.?Ç¬? Since Madge caught her trying to walk to the grocery store, her daughter has been ordering (over the internet) groceries to be delivered, but she still needs to go to the bank once a month.

Madge was busy with two sick kids yesterday ?¢?Ç¨?Äú Sophia was asleep in bed and Lauryn was in jammies ?¢?Ç¨?Äú when Grandma Lee walked past yesterday.?Ç¬? Several minutes went by before she realized that this sweet elderly woman was wearing a hat and handbag and, regardless of our previous offerings to help, was attempting to trek somewhere again.?Ç¬? But despite feeling responsible to help her, Madge didn't dare leave Lauryn and Sophia alone while she ran down the street to look for and stop her.

I was at work, a few blocks away, packing up my cubicle as our office is moving.?Ç¬? I understood Madge's position but still felt obligated, and compelled, to look out for, and find, this aged soul.?Ç¬? We don't live close to our own parents and I often feel bad for not being in a position to assist them, but find it consoling to be able to keep an eye on our aged neighbour in their stead. 

After deducing the direction she most likely walked, as she uses bus-stop benches as resting places, I ran off from work to a place on a nearby road where I hoped I'd be able to find her.?Ç¬? It had been about 25 minutes since Madge had first seen her, and she didn't expect I'd be able to find her.?Ç¬? But as I ran up to the corner where I was going to start looking, I was amazed to see Grandma Lee standing next to the stop-light pole, waiting to cross the street. 

I ran up and told her, "Hi, I'm your neighbour, are you ok?"?Ç¬? I was glad to see both surprise and relief enter her face, and I quickly told her that Brenda would come and we could drive her to her bank.?Ç¬? I had a two-way radio with me and was able to talk to Madge at home to tell her that I'd indeed found Grandma Lee, and where she could find us.?Ç¬? (By then Lauryn had gotten dressed and Sophia had woken up.)

I helped her shuffle back to a nearby bench where we waited for Madge.?Ç¬? She told me of her plan and how she underestimated the distance.?Ç¬? When she drives in her car, it seems so close, but she'd only been able to walk 1/6 of the way.?Ç¬? She feels like if she gives up some of her independence that she'll quickly lose all her abilities.?Ç¬? For her age she does amazingly well, but I feel its rather risky to live completely alone and independent, especially now that she's losing the capability of caring for herself.?Ç¬? But, as with many elderly people, she doesn't want to live in a "home," so for now she'll keep on alone.?Ç¬?  Hopefully we'll be able to keep her from voyaging.

I think that this is a good example of why i adore you guys.  I got a package of yummy valentine cookies and treats yesterday.  Thanks, I totally wasn't expecting anything, so it came as a wonderful surprise.

Sometime Tina will escape this binding mortal coil - but your kindness will live on and one.

Thanks for inspiring me and making things better just with the ray of goodness that surrounds you.]]></wp:comment_content>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[More than two years ago I bought Lauryn a dolly.?Ç¬? If you squeeze its hand or tummy it makes little cooing or crying sounds.?Ç¬? At first she was scared of it.?Ç¬? Then just disinterested.?Ç¬? But in the past two weeks she's really gotten into "Mommying" her baby.?Ç¬? Her name is "Charlie".

After playing with and talking about the baby doll today, this sequence spilled out.

Lauryn: She's sad because she has a sore tummy
Mom: &nbsp;&nbsp;Why does she have a sore tummy?
Lauryn: Because she has a hard spot in her tummy
Mom: &nbsp;&nbsp;How did she get a hard spot in her tummy?
Lauryn: Betause she swallowed a bee.
Mom: &nbsp;&nbsp;Did she mean to swallow a bee?
Lauryn: Nope, it just buzzed right in
Mom: &nbsp;&nbsp;Oh.
Lauryn: I need to det (get) her some medicine to make it better
Lauryn: (Leaves and comes back.) I have the medicine
Mom: &nbsp;&nbsp;Did you get it from the Doctor?
Lauryn: Nope, I just found it.?Ç¬? I would give it to her (runs away with the doll).
Audible: *slurp*
Lauryn: (Runs back) She needed FOUR parts of medicine.?Ç¬? Now I have to burp her. (Pat, pat, pat, pat...)
Mom: &nbsp;&nbsp;You take care of your dolly
Lauryn: I knowed how
Audible: *burp*
Lauryn: The bee flew out.
Mom: &nbsp;&nbsp;It did?
Lauryn: With her burp.?Ç¬? Oh, no, she swallowed it again.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[About the day that the <a href="http://www.isopraxis.net/archives/2005/03/04/sorry-for-the-downtime">improbability drive went down</a>, I was intending to make a "What's New" post.?É?Äö?Ç¬? Fortunately, the site is back up and nothing was lost in the drive failure.?É?Äö?Ç¬? Unfortunately, the title speaks to my current situation.?É?Äö?Ç¬? Alas, this brief update will merely list events so hopefully one day I can record them properly.

<strong>Visitors</strong>
First Clovis came and visited.?É?Äö?Ç¬? We took a bunch of pics in Del Mar at the beach and then he and I made a dusk trip to TJ.?É?Äö?Ç¬? It was a good Saturday together with our first official visitor (other than Brenda's parents).?É?Äö?Ç¬? Naturally we don't intend for it to be as long until we hang out with the Under-water Chicken Rancher again, but we also don't make any promises

Next, Rick and Ren?É?í?Ç¬©e took a vacation from the bleary cold of Ottawa to the rainy climes of SoCal.?É?Äö?Ç¬? Rain and cloudy weather kept us from having a good beach day, and a trip to Old Town burned up the only sunny and warm day we had.?É?Äö?Ç¬? Not that it mattered much to me, though, as an unforeseen problem at work kept me experimenting late each night for almost the entirety of their visit.?É?Äö?Ç¬? I managed to escape on the weekend, and we spend two good days in LA.?É?Äö?Ç¬? The highlight was definitely the <a href="http://www.getty.edu/">J. Paul Getty Museum</a>, but we saw a few other fun things and were glad to hang out with Rick again and to get to know Ren?É?í?Ç¬©e better.

<a href="http://www.biffard.com/">Ryan and Cam</a> also graced us with a visit, one week after R &#38; R, and again it was raining ?É¬¢?¢?Äö¬¨?¢?Ç¨?ì even worse.?É?Äö?Ç¬? Cam got to play with the <a href="http://www.novatelwireless.com/products/merlin/merlin-v620.html">EVDO wireless modem</a> I recently finished helping design at work as we drove back from the airport in LA, and we generally had a good time playing Canadian Trivial Pursuit, home-made Scattergories, and Phase 10, visiting the Wild Animal park in the rain, playing on the beach and boogie boarding in the rather cool water.?É?Äö?Ç¬? Ryan's took lots of good pictures - <a href="http://www.biffard.com/family/">check them out</a>.?É?Äö?Ç¬? One day I'll post my own (duplicate?) gallery.

<strong>Kids</strong>
Our two blondes sure have fun together.?É?Äö?Ç¬? Lauryn is a great role-model and Sophia is anxious to do all that her sister does.?É?Äö?Ç¬? She's rapidly moved from scooting to crawling, to furniture surfing, to stair scampering in the past two (three?) weeks.?É?Äö?Ç¬? We've caught her free-standing for several (5+) seconds at a time, but I get chastised for encouraging her, as she is already constantly putting herself in precarious positions.?É?Äö?Ç¬? Her latest trick is to climb the back of our folding kitchen chairs, grab the top of the backrest, put her feet on the bottom bar, and have the chair tip over backwards onto her.?É?Äö?Ç¬? She flip-flops between being unable to have her body contain her happiness (and flopping around, and kicking, in glee) and moaning, wailing, and writhing about with teething pain.

Lauryn's skills and capabilities make us happy, and its hard to not be too proud.?É?Äö?Ç¬? She's slowed (a bit) on the number of "why" questions asked each day, but she remembers the answers and is very sincere in asking why.?É?Äö?Ç¬? She loves to run and screech as her sister "chases" her, and she's probably glad that her hair is getting pulled less and less.?É?Äö?Ç¬? Madge stays busy keeping Lauryn "tasked" with fun things to do, and everyone has to stay on their toes to make sure Sophia doesn't get too far up our dangerous stairs without supervision.

<strong>Work</strong>
Work has been satisfying but altogether too busy for my tastes. Usually this busyness comes in waves, but this wave is lasting a bit longer than normal.?É?Äö?Ç¬? We're working on exciting stuff and moving forward very quickly, but with fast pace design, testing, prototyping, and evaluation comes potential oversight, time constraints, problems, and a general need to work long hours (to fix the problems).?É?Äö?Ç¬? It doesn't help when previous projects urgently need attention, and trade shows demand timely results.?É?Äö?Ç¬? We've been fairly lucky, but there's still lots to do.

I'm really trying to devote my non-work hours to my family, as often in the past few weeks I've been forced to stay extra late at work.?É?Äö?Ç¬? Every moment with my sweet girls is precious to me, so some of my personal side-projects have naturally taken a back seat.?É?Äö?Ç¬? But I feel that's the way it should be.?É?Äö?Ç¬? Not this busy, but that family should take precedence whenever possible.

Back to the grindstone,
Sk][p

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I had a need recently to look up precision resistor standard values, and ran across this Electronic Design page: <a href="http://www.elecdesign.com/Articles/Index.cfm?AD=1&ArticleID=1480" id="1480">http://www.elecdesign.com/Articles/Index.cfm?AD=1&#38;ArticleID=1480</a>.?Ç¬? The formula listed on the page was rather long and unwieldy, so I didn't even try it, but the smrt people who made comments had two good formulas that do the same thing.

<div class=quote>=ROUND(10^(ROUND(96*(LOG10(A1)-INT(LOG10(A1))),0)/96),2)*10^(INT(LOG10(A1)))

<title>Remote Install of OS X Applications</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[In my role as a technical consultant for those family members and friends around me who have Macs (a number which has greatly increased over the past 7 years), the occasion has arisen when I have the need to remotely install an application (.mpkg or .pkg) on an OS X box from the command line.

The machine might be inaccessible or I don't want to "talk" someone through the process, and usually the only access I have is by way of SSH.

One of the typical reasons is to upgrade a remote machine to support Apple Remote Desktop 2.?Ç¬? ARD (the admin program) has the ability to remotely copy and install applications, but usually it fails or says that it can't.?Ç¬? Here's my solution (replace the parts in italics).

<ol><li>?Ç¬? Find the InstallerPackage.pkg (or .mpkg) in the terminal and (as it's a <a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/CoreFoundation/Conceptual/CFBundles/index.html">bundle</a>) tar it up.?Ç¬? (For Apple Remote Desktop I referred to this <a href="http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20040802111556904">MacOSXHints page</a>.) </li>
<ul><li style="list-style-type:none;"><span style="font-family:monospace;font-size:9pt;">tar -zcvf <em>InstallerPackage.pkg</em>.tar.gz <em>/path/to/InstallerPackage.pkg</em>.tar.gz</span></li></ul>
<li>?Ç¬? SCP/SFTP the package to the remote machine.</li>
<ul><li style="list-style-type:none;"><span style="font-family:monospace;font-size:9pt;">scp <em>InstallerPackage.pkg</em>.tar.gz <em>username</em>@<em>address</em>:<em>/path/to/destination</em></span></li></ul>
<li>?Ç¬?untar the package in an SSH terminal</li>
<ul><li style="list-style-type:none;"><span style="font-family:monospace;font-size:9pt;">tar -zxvf <em>/path/to/destination/InstallerPackage.pkg</em>.tar.gz <em>/path/to/untarred/location</em></span></li></ul>
<li>?Ç¬? Install the program in an SSH terminal(this is the critical command that I found on this other <a href="http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=2005050606123892">MacOSXHints page</a>.)</li>
<ul><li style="list-style-type:none;"><span style="font-family:monospace;font-size:9pt;"> sudo /usr/sbin/installer -verbose -pkg <em>InstallerPackage.pkg</em> -target /</span></li></ul>
</ol>

I'm not certain what happens if you install a program that requires rebooting after install, but this has saved me several times and is worth sharing.  Enjoy.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[So <a href="http://rantastic.spacemonkeys.ca/archives/256-Tag!.html">Tamara "tagged" me</a> and then had the audacity (just kidding) to say that I blog infrequently and would be unlikely to respond to the tagging.  Well, I wanted to respond immediately, but well, better late than never(?).

But before I pay my tagging penance, I'd just like to throw down a lazy excuse that I've been busy.  Between working on an under-staffed, unreasonable-schedule project, wrapping up loose ends on living in San Diego, moving my family North 2600 km (and driving it both ways), traveling back to San Diego for a week, unpacking, and trying to make progress on a few-too-many side projects, I've had no time to spill the thoughts trapped in my brain into this archivable format.  So this will be two posts in the same day.  Think I can keep it up?

<strong>Number of books I own:</strong>
Simple answer - not enough, thought I don't have/make the time to finish reading them.  I need to amass more technical books.  As a poor student I avoided purchasing textbooks due to their exorbitant costs.  Now that my purchasing power has been increased, I find I really <strong>need</strong> to add these to my library.
Real answer - probably only 50.

<strong>Last Book I Bought:</strong>
<p style="text-align:left">

<a href="http://www.amazon.ca/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/013898008X/">"Technical Analysis of the Future's Markets" (John J. Murphy, Murphy)</a>
</p>A fantastic book if you're interested in the Stock/Options/Futures Markets.  I read a good portion on a flight to China and bought this $120 book for $5 from a "new and used" Amazon affiliate.

<strong>Last Book I Read:</strong>
<p style="text-align:left">

<a href="http://www.amazon.ca/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0425179613/">"It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life" (Lance Armstrong)</a>
</p>I burned through this one in just over 24 hours by reading while walking to and from work, during lunch, and instead of sleeping.  That's my trouble with non-technical books, once I pick it up I can't put it down until I'm done.  This one gives a great insight into Lance's life-changing experience with testicular, lung, and brain cancer and his amazing recovery, incredible determination, and his return to the world of competitive cycling (and the first two of his now-six wins of the sport's crowning race).  A very encouraging book with regard to overcoming life's obstacles.  However, it was saddening to me to read about his relationship and marriage to Kit knowing that it has since "failed."  

<strong>Five Books That Mean a Lot to Me:</strong>
<ol>
<li><p style="text-align:left">
<img src="http://images.amazon.com/images/P/0440412676.01._SCTHUMBZZZ_.jpg" /><br />
<a href="http://www.amazon.ca/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0440412676/">"Where the Red Fern Grows" (Wilson Rawls)</a>
</p>Madge and I are midway through this and its one of my all-time favorites.</li>
<li><p style="text-align:left">
<img src="http://images.amazon.com/images/P/0425133516.01._SCTHUMBZZZ_.jpg" /><br />
<a href="http://www.amazon.ca/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0425133516/">"The Hunt for Red October" (Tom Clancy)</a>
</p>I've read this and a few other Tom Clancy page-turners more times than I can count (I think I've read either Hunt for Red October or Clear and Present Danger 7 times).  The last one I read was while traveling to/from Korea I think.</li>
<li><p style="text-align:left">
<img src="http://images.amazon.com/images/P/0898868289.01._SCTHUMBZZZ_.jpg" /><br />
<a href="http://www.amazon.ca/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0898868289/">"Mountaineering: The Freedom of the Hills" (Mountaineers Books)</a>
</p>This is the "Climber's Bible" and has come in handy several times.  Need to refresh your knowledge of knots, crevasse rescue, ice/rock/snow climbing, glissading, etc?  Anyone who does more than car-camping should have a copy and browse through it before any outing (or pack it).  You never know what situation you'll need to overcome.</li>
<li><p style="text-align:left">
<img src="http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1579122213.01._SCTHUMBZZZ_.jpg" /><br />
<a href="http://www.amazon.ca/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1579122213/">"How to Stay Alive in the Woods: A Complete Guide to Food, Shelter and Self-Preservation Anywhere" (Bradford Angier)</a>
</p>This is a recent acquisition that I haven't gotten through yet - but if you want to know what/how to find something to eat when you don't think there's anything, this is the book for you.  Stew stinging nettle, eat insects, but just don't eat too many rabbits.</li>
<li><p style="text-align:left">
<img src="http://images.amazon.com/images/P/0672322307.01._SCTHUMBZZZ_.jpg" /><br />
<a href="http://www.amazon.ca/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0672322307/">"Cocoa Programming" (Scott  Anguish, Erik  Buck, Donald  Yacktman)</a>
</p>I've read a good amounts of this one and get excited every time I think about reading more.  Its well written and clear, but sadly I haven't (yet) been able to capitalize on the knowledge contained therein.  I have plans and intentions, and Objective-C and Cocoa are so nice to play with.  If only I could immerse myself in it for a month or two...</li>
</ol>
<strong>Five More Bloggers</strong>
I'm going to abstain, but feel like swapping it out for <strong>Five Books I'd Like to Acquire</strong>.  Sadly, I don't have the time to build that list at the moment either...

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Prior to moving to San Diego just over a year ago, I enjoyed riding my rigid '93 Specialized StumpJumper the 8.78 km work every day.  Some day's I'd ride over Nose Hill, but mostly, and especially during the winter, I'd ride the path parallel to John Laurie and then tuck through some quiet residential roads to Northmount and on to Deerfoot and 64th Avenue NE.  During that time I began to suffer an incredible amount of pain in my right wrist.  I consulted a Doctor and tried to eliminate all potential sources of Repetitive Stress Injury (RSI) that could be literally killing my wrist.  I went on the Foosball injured list, I stopped using a mouse, I was careful about my typing positioning, I began wearing a wrist guard, and I was very careful about how and when I bent or put weight on my wrist.

And then we moved, and apart from being cautious holding Sophia, my wrist injury became mostly forgotten.  That is, until work switched offices and I began riding my my bike to work again.  Within one week my wrist and arm were hurting more than ever, and the only thing that had changed in my routine was bombing down the valley to work.  The mountain bike hand positioning (and lack of suspension) was continually jarring my wrist and I was suffering once more.  I immediately stopped riding and ran and walked to work instead (ask me about the <a href="http://www.wf.net/~snake/rattlesn.htm">Western Diamondback Rattlesnakes</a> sometime).

And then we moved home, and I was in a dire situation.  I don't want to own a second car, and its too far to walk.  I'm not a fan of the bus and it doesn't really go where I need it to, so either I get a ride to and from work, or I figure out a way to bike.  

After thinking about the circumstances behind my recent wrist-injury aggravation, I decided that I most likely would be able to write a road bike (with drop-bars) and thereby keep my hand inline with my forearm and my wrist would not need to bend, flex or bear any strain.  I quickly researched road bikes and went into my local Trek shop and was enamoured with the <a href="http://www2.trekbikes.com/Bikes/Road/Performance_Road/Madone/Index.php">Trek Madones</a>.  Unfortunately, it snows here, and I want to ride year-round.  Phil at <a href="http://www.calgarycycle.com/">Calgary Cycle</a> recommended that I try out a Cyclocross bike instead of a pure road bike.  Cross bikes are of a very similar geometry to Road Bikes, but are built with more fork-to-tire clearance to accommodate larger (ie. knobbier) tires, and allow snow/mud/fender clearance.  High end carbon fiber road bikes are built for the road, and my route to work is definitely a mixed track and a Cross is decidedly the more suitable vehicle.  The next day I rode off on my new <a href="http://www2.trekbikes.com/Bikes/Specialty_Bikes/Cyclocross/XO_1/index.php">Trek X0 1</a> and within a couple of days I knew that cycling would no longer be a major source of wrist injury.

But my path to work, as I said, is mixed (pavement and grass/dirt/rocks), and the jarring movements that occur as I blaze across the landscape scare me.  So I've modified my route and have dropped farther down the side of Nose Hill to ride on the paved surface of <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=cayuga+crescent+nw+calgary+alberta+canada&spn=0.032726,0.072325&hl=en">Cayuga Crescent</a>.

Fortunately, the days of heading down to Capri and Cayuga will soon be over.  Several weeks ago I noticed surveyor markings at the one end of the offensive mixed section of park between 19th Street and 14th Street.  Yesterday a crew was out digging up the grass and topsoil and a paved pathway appears to be under construction.  I was ready to email my alderman and request such a pathway, as only this small section of parkland parallel to John Laurie doesn't have a paved path.  Its absence has caused the creation of at least 4 different parallel paths, and really, only one path should be necessary.  

I believe that fundamentally people tend to that which is easiest or most convenient.  If the given situation it isn't easy, convenient or absolutely necessary, people tend to create or do the next easiest thing regardless.  Thus the creation of a paved path (as long as it goes in the most reasonable location and in a mostly straight line) will keep people from tramping down the grass and creating their own route through this rather narrow park.  Dogs can wander either side (but I'll kick them if they come after me), and kids can roam in the grass, but the majority of the traffic will tend to follow the most convenient, soon-to-be-paved path.

Give people the most obvious choice, and they'll follow it without thinking of alternatives.

ps.  This same idea applies, in my opinion, to the paving of <strong><em>SELECT</em></strong> paths in Nose Hill Park.  If you give them the most desirable routes, the secondary routes will grow over.  If you leave it "unguided" nothing will motivate people to stop charting their own course.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Using Wordpress, Audio Hijack Pro and Applescript </h3>

The local Campus/Community Radio Station ?¢?Ç¨?Äú <a href="http://www.cjsw.com">CJSW</a> ?¢?Ç¨?Äú has some pretty good shows but I never manage to listen to them except by accident.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast">Podcasting</a> has been growing as a movement and with the recent addition of Podcatching features (retrieving Podcasts) to <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/">iTunes</a>, I figured this would be the beginning of the popularity surge of this subscription format of acquiring audio content.  The most natural fit of this technology, on a rather private scale, would be the ability to time-shift (think <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tivo">Tivo</a>) CJSW radio shows and publish these archives so a few close friends can enjoy them as well.

I use WordPress to publish this site (and a few others) and with my recent upgrading to version 1.5 along came the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Podcasting">podcast feature of WordPress</a> to automatically detect links to .mp3 files and store the info necessary to generate the enclosure tag in the RSS2.0 feed.

So a few tests later and I had content available for subscription through iTunes (by manually entering the URL of the RSS feed).

Now came the tough part(s).  To automate the process of capturing and publishing the shows, I was obligated to overcome the following obstacles:
<h4>Problems</h4>
<ol>
<li>Capture the .mp3 stream from CJSW.com to a bookmarkable AAC (.m4a).  Bookmarkable AACs are desirable because new-ish iPods and iTunes will keep track of the point in the track where you last stopped and will resume from that point the next time you play it.</li>
<li>Gather the data for the RSS enclosure tag.  The enclosure tag includes a link to the audio file, the size of the file in bytes, and the MIME type of the file (audio/mpeg).
<span style="font-size: 9px; font-family: monospace;">&#60;enclosure 
             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;url="http://www.cbc.ca/quirks/media/2004-2005/mp3/qq-2004-12-18a.mp3" 
             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;length="10036870" 
             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;type="audio/mpeg"/&#62;</span>
</li>
<li>Create a new WordPress post linking to the audio file.  (Luckily my sites are served from a Mac and I can capture the same machine, eliminating the need of ftping the completed capture to the webserver.)</li>
</ol>
<h4>Solutions</h4>
<ol>
<li>The most natural choice for capturing the stream is <a href="http://www.rogueamoeba.com/audiohijackpro/">Audio Hijack Pro</a>.  It will record from any source, can mute the source while capturing, is easily schedulable, and can run an applescript at the completion of the capture.  It can also record directly to AAC Bookmarkable, Audio filters can be applied real-time to the capture to "improve" the quality, and, well, <a href="http://www.rogueamoeba.com/">Rogue Amoeba</a> has a cool logo.</li>

<li>It was relatively simple to look up the file name and file size using Applescript.  Basically I just look in the folder where AHP stores the .m4a for any files that <strong>haven't</strong> been tagged with a label.  I look up the size in bytes and then tag the file with a label so it can get ignored next time.</li>

<li>Early on I'd detected that while WordPress will automatically generate the info necessary for the enclosure tag for .mp3 files, it was completely ignorant of .m4a files.  The web-form for creating and publishing new WordPress posts allow you to add custom data fields to any post (where the enclosure key and value are stored), but my preferred, and highly scriptable, desktop blogging software, ecto, doesn't appear to have this same capability.  I needed to come up with an alternate method of automatically publishing new posts.

I've known for a while that Safari is Applescript-able, but I've only ever used it for automatically loading and refreshing pages.  While poking through some of the <a href="http://www.apple.com/applescript/safari/">Safari Applescript documentation</a> I discovered that recent versions of <a href="http://www.apple.com/applescript/safari/jscript.01.html">Safari respond to JavaScript called by AppleScript</a>.  This can allow you to look up and modify DOM elements of any web page (given that you can figure out how to reference the element).  

So here was my plan, script Safari to load the WordPress post page (assuming I'm already logged in), and then populate the Title, Post, and custom tag fields with the appropriate information and click the Publish button <strong>all</strong> by way of Applescript JavaScript calls. This would let me have .m4a enclosures and everything should be spiffy.</li></ol>

<blockquote>Aside: Truthfully this is precisely one of the strongest points of OS X.  Applescript is usually painful to work with due to its atypical syntax and horrible error messages.  Just because an Applescript dictionary appears to list functionality you can use, that doesn't mean you can figure out how to use it.  However, the simple ability of being able to use one Applescript to drive GUI elements, modify web page content, make system (ie. terminal) calls, and link multiple applications together in a workflow is amazing.    Yes, "unix" pipes can do wonderful things, but are there really any other ways of automating the process of filling in a web-form (other than with default personal details)?</blockquote>

After getting frustrated being unable to reference and successfully manipulate the web-form elements, I uncovered this <a href="http://rentzsch.com/applescript/applescriptingSafariForms">Applescript code snippet</a> posted by one of the smartest Mac developers around.  The second code snippet is exactly what I needed in order to identify the number of the elements I wanted to modify.

Once I was able to fill in the form, I still had a difficulty.  The way that WordPress converts the custom enclosure tag value (a string) into the three elements of the RSS enclosure tag is by reading an end of line character after each item.  That is, the audio file URL, the size of the file in bytes, and the MIME type of the file are deliminated by end of line (<span style="font-size: 9px; font-family: monospace;">'\n'</span>) characters.  Try as I might, there was NO way that I could include that end of line character in my Applescript/JavaScript and get that field populated with data.  Either Safari didn't like the <span style="font-size: 9px; font-family: monospace;">'\n'</span> in the middle of the JavaScript or Applescript didn't like it in the middle of the JavaScript.  (This is precisely why Applescript can be so maddening - you never get the kind of error reporting that would typically enable you to figure it out.)

So I had automated the creation of a WordPress post, but I couldn't write the enclosure data in a format that WordPress would understand when it attempts to create the enclosure tag in the RSS feed.

There was only one solution left - modify WordPress.  

While it was difficult to find the WordPress code that scans the post for links to .mp3 files (ie. I never found it), it was rather easy to find the code that splits the enclosure tag value at each newline (<span style="font-size: 9px; font-family: monospace;">'\n'</span>) and generates the enclosure tag with a quick grep for enclosure.

The <span style="font-size: 9px; font-family: monospace;">rss_enclosure()</span> function in <span style="font-size: 9px; font-family: monospace;">wp-includes/feed-functions.php</span> includes the following code:

<code>if( $key == 'enclosure' ) {
                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if (is_array($val)) {
                                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;foreach($val as $enc) {
                                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$enclosure = split( "\n", $enc );
                                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print "&#60;enclosure url='".trim( htmlspecialchars($enclosure[ 0 ]) )."' length='".tr
im( $enclosure[ 1 ] )."' type='".trim( $enclosure[ 2 ] )."'/&#62;\n";
                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
                        }
</code>
Which, when the enclosure key is found splits the enclosure value (<span style="font-size: 9px; font-family: monospace;">$enc</span>) into an array of strings as separated by newlines (<span style="font-size: 9px; font-family: monospace;">'\n'</span>).  It then prints the actual enclosure tag using the values at each index of <span style="font-size: 9px; font-family: monospace;">$enclosure</span>.
I quick read of the <a href="http://ca3.php.net/split">php manual</a> made it clear that a more efficient method of doing this split into an array would be with the explode() function.  So I decided that I'd use my own delimiter (a semicolon) and then change Wordpress to explode <span style="font-size: 9px; font-family: monospace;">$enc</span> based on <span style="font-size: 9px; font-family: monospace;">'\n'</span> if it is present (the default) or on a semicolon <span style="font-size: 9px; font-family: monospace;">';'</span> (my situation).  This is the resulting code:

<code>
if( $key == 'enclosure' ) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if (is_array($val)) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;foreach($val as $enc) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if(strpos($enc, "\n"))
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$enclosure = explode( "\n", $enc );
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;else
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$enclosure = explode(";", $enc );
                                                
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print "&#60;enclosure url='".trim( htmlspecialchars($enclosure[ 0 ]) )."' length='".tr
im( $enclosure[ 1 ] )."' type='".trim( $enclosure[ 2 ] )."'/&#62;\n";
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
                        }
</code>

And it appears to work.  

Naturally the likelihood of violating someone's copyright by time-shifting and redistribution these streaming-audio (radio) captures is highly likely.  But I defend that:
<ol>
<li>The captured streams aren't beautiful quality.  They're nice but nothing nearly as clear as owning the original CD, so no one is going to be losing CD sales.</li>
<li>I may, at best, cause more interest in the artists featured, spurring CD and concert sales</li>
<li>At worst, I'll be the only person to use what I've created.</li>
<li>I encourage anyone who makes use of my CJSW podcasts to <a href="http://www.cjsw.com/about/funding.php">support the station by donating to their funding drive</a> each fall (or anytime).  Its your donations to <em>them</em> that you and me to be able to listen and learn of new artists.</li>
</ol>

So enjoy the podcasts (not hosted here) and support independent radio and the artists.  And comment on any shows that I should podcast.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I grew up eating most anything.  I'm not talking about food served at the table, but generally anything that could possibly be considered edible, I've probably tried or would be willing to try.

My brother almost fooled me into taking a finger-lick of grease after he opened a new tube for the grease-gun and he told me it was chocolate pudding.  I also once ate a bee that had been squished by a french dictionary and two encyclopedias (for a bit less than $10).  I've eaten every sort of grass or plant imaginable.  And I've tried most berries (early on I was told to stay away from Buffalo Beans - AKA golden bean/buck bean/yellow pea/Golden Pea/False Lupine).

Basically, after a long hot day at the farm, anything will taste good.

I can only eat a small quantity of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfalfa">Alfalfa</a> before the taste starts to bother me (its rather "rich" in flavour - like its full of minerals).  Pulling most any grass/grain apart will reveal a tender section that's quite pleasant.  Many flowers taste OK - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose">Roses</a> are on the bottom of my list (but <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose_hips">rose hips</a> are good - esp. from the Alberta Wild Rose), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnation">Carnations</a> are at the top.  (I once played a dinner-game where the goal of the game was to eat the carnation out of the centerpiece vase without anyone outside of the participants noticing.  I didn't win, and I didn't even notice the winner making the move).  I've licked sap, chewed on bark, eaten leaves, you name it.  But berries are the best.

I once went camping with some people who wanted to go for a hike over some rolling prairie hills.  Climbing out of one valley I noticed some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juneberry">Saskatoon berry</a> bushes, announced their presence, and started picking and eating.  The camp leaders were astonished at my stupidity - eating something that was just growing out of the hillside.  They couldn't possibly fathom that something so delicious could "just grow" out in the middle of nowhere.  After a great amount of convincing (backed up by the quantity I was enjoying) everyone soon began to participate.  (I also love <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chokecherry">Chokecherries</a>, but it was too early in the year for them to be ripe.)

Living in France it wasn't uncommon for me to hop off my bike and just start eating the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackberry">blackberries</a> that seemed to grow on every hedgerow.  They were delicious in August (and otherwise wasted).

Yesterday, we went for a walk through the park, enjoying this glorious warm weather.  Heading up the hill toward Dama's house, Madge spotted some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Prunus_tomentosa">Nanking Cherry</a> bushes covered in ripe berries.  (She was initially shocked as well when I claimed I recognized these "berries" several years ago and began eating them.)  We used Lauryn's hat and soon had it filled with the sweet round cherries.  Madge had the plan of making jelly, and this evening we followed through.  It is <strong><em>delicious</em></strong>.  For reference I'm listing the recipe.  I think we didn't need as much pectin as the recipe calls out.  (We used Bernardin Pectin - a 57g box). Next time I think we'll cut it in half and see how that does.

<center>
<h4>Nanking Cherry Jelly</h4>
<ul>
<li>6 cups Nanking cherries</li>
<li>1 cup water</li>
<li>1 pkg powered pectin</li>
<li>4.5 cups sugar</li>
</ul><ul>
Stem and wash cherries.  Place in a saucepan with the water.  Bring water to a boil; simmer 15-20 minutes until fruit is soft.  Mash fruit to press out juice; strain.  Return juice to saucepan and stir in pectin crystals.  Stir over high heat until boiling.  Stir in sugar and bring to a vigorous boil for 1 minute stirring constantly.  Pour into sterilized jars and seal with parafin (we used boiled/sterilized snap lids).
</ul></center>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Every Saturday morning we usually enjoy a good breakfast.  Typically its Madge's wholesome pancakes, and Lauryn gets a novelty pancake in the shape of any animal she wishes (usually a puppy, but even lions, kangaroos, and ???).  [insert pic of fancy pancake]  Today we enjoyed Belgian Waffles.  Yum.  I figured I'd share our favorite (yet basic) recipe, and what I think is key to making good waffes.

<div class="quote"><h3>Quick Waffles</h3><ul><li>1/2 C. butter or margarine</li><li>1 T. sugar</li><li>4 egg yolks</li><li>2 C. milk</li><li>2 C. flour</li><li>4 egg whites, stiffly beaten</li><li>4 t. baking powder</li></ul><h4>Directions:</h4>  Melt butter; stir in the sugar and egg yolks.  Beat well.  Beat in milk and sifted flour; fold in egg whites and baking powder.  Bake in a greased waffle iron.  Store leftover waffles, wrapped in plastic wrap or foil, in refrigerator;  reheat in toaster or in frying pan.

<h4>Skip's Counsel</h4>If there is anything I learned when I briefly attended a cooking class in France, its how important good egg whites are in recipes.  Even a tiny amout of yolk will keep the whites from being their stiffest.  There was also something about adding salt, or cream of tartar.  Evidently I don't remember all the details, except that stiff egg whites are important, that you shouldn't over-beat them, and how important it is to delicately fold them into whatever you're making.

That is, I think, the secret to good waffles - good egg whites, folded in carefully.  Any waffle recipe that does not include beaten egg whites isn't worth the effort (though it may be simpler).  Good waffles need good whites, otherwise you might as well buy <a href="http://www.kelloggs.com/cgi-bin/brandpages/product.pl?product=190&company=3">Eggo</a> :) </div>

On realizing that I've forgotten many of the details learned in the 5-franc-an-episode cooking class, I decided to look up the secrets to making perfect egg whites.  I found a fantastic page, but despite its wonderful content, it looks awful.  I plan on cleaning it up and reposting it here.  Watch for it and then make perfect waffles.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Apple has a <a href="http://developer.apple.com/internet/opensource/opensourcescripting.html">great introduction document for the scripting languages built into Mac OS X</a>.  If you've wondered what the "Terminal" is all about or how you can easily automate processes, write simple programs, or develop dynamic websites this is probably a good place to start.  It contains links to all the relevant sources of beginner information and even talks about building new versions of the tools (including grabbing source code from CVS).

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Shortly after receiving a new laptop at work I went about figuring out how to resize the NTFS partition so that I could install Linux on the other half of the disk.  I was going to document the process, but...

Recently, however, my Windows partition was having issues so IT reinstalled XP on the first partition.  This process caused my Master Boot Record (MBR) to get overwritten.  My laptop no-longer knew that it could boot into either Windows or Linux (Ubuntu).  I needed to restore the MBR.

A bit of googling and I found this thread: <a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-24113.html">http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-24113.html</a>

The steps that worked for me were near the bottom of the page (I've adapted them for my scenario).

<ol>
<li>Boot with any live CD (I used <a href="http://www.knoppix-std.org/">Knoppix STD 0.1</a> as it has some fun tools)</li>
<li>Get a root shell and <code>fdisk -l /dev/hda</code></li>
<li>make note of which partition is your main 'Linux' partition (mine is <code>/dev/hda3</code>)</li>
<li>make a folder (<code>mkdir ubuntu</code>)</li>
<li>mount the root (/) partition of ubuntu (e.g. <code>mount /dev/hda3 ubuntu</code> - the 'Linux' disk from fdisk)</li>
<li>chroot the mounted partition (<code>chroot ubuntu</code>)</li>
<li><code>grub-install /dev/hda</code> (If you are multi-booting with Windows, make sure you do NOT install the MBR on the active partition (/dev/hda3) but on the drive (/dev/hda).)</li>
<li>Exit the shell</li>
<li>Reboot</li>
</ol>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger</a> is nice.  I can't <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/printing/">print</a> to <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/windows/">Windows printers</a> anymore.  And the Junk Mail filter for <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/mail/">Mail</a> causes Mail to crash.

While trying to figure out what was making Mail crash incessantly, I started fresh with Mail, setting all new preferences and accounts, but I was careful to keep an old copy of my ~/Library/Mail folder so I could recover all my old sent items and whatnot.

Luckily for me, the Tiger version of Mail (v2.0) won't import <em>its own</em> .emlx files.  Talk about frustration.  I moved the .emlx files around in the ~/Library/Mail folder and looked at plists but nothing would let me import or drag and drop the .emlx files into Mail itself.  However, I could double-click <em>any</em> of the .emlx files and Mail would display them.  Talk about a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Jekyll_and_Mr._Hyde">Jekyll and Hyde</a> syndrome.

Fortunately someone else already encountered and solved this problem.  The <a href="http://www.cosmicsoft.net/emlxconvert.html">emlx to mbox Converter</a> will take .emlx files and save them all as a standard .mbox file the Mail <em>can</em> import.

Ironically, Apple lists this same software on its <a href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/unix_open_source/emlxtomboxconverter.html">website of Mac OS X-compatible software</a>.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I didn't come up with this myself.  I'm just <a href="http://www.uneasysilence.com/os-x-proven-hacked-and-running-on-an-ordinary-pc/">mirroring it</a> for reference lest the original source disappear.  Luckily I think I have a donor machine that's suitable, and I already have the Ubuntu Live CD (go Ubuntu!)

<blockquote>First of all, you can?¢?Ç¨?Ñ¢t install OS X on a new partition, it needs it?¢?Ç¨?Ñ¢s own drive. For this guide Im installing it on my Sony Vaio TR2A. Since I only have one harddrive, it means I?¢?Ç¨?Ñ¢m wiping windows and all my files in the process. You can easily follow the same steps but instead install it on a second harddrive in your PC. Here is how I have succesfully install OS X x86 NATIVELY on my laptop!
First of all, I think your CPU needs at LEAST sse2. For rosetta and to get itunes and other ppc apps working, you need sse3. My vaio has a Pentuim M, so no rosetta for me. Everything else works. Im posting this from the OS X x86 port of Firefox Wink
1. Download ?¢?Ç¨?ìVMWare files for patched Mac OS X Tiger Intel?¢?Ç¨? from your favorite torrent site. (Hint: Use the search function).
2. Copy tiger-x86-flat.img from the archive to an external USB drive (it?¢?Ç¨?Ñ¢s 6gb)
3. Download Ubuntu Live CD (link) ?¢?Ç¨¬¶ be sure you get the ?¢?Ç¨?ìLive CD?¢?Ç¨?!!
4. Burn the ubuntu iso, stick it in your pc, and boot it! (make sure you have your bios set to boot to CD)
5. Once ubuntu boots and the gui finally comes up, hook up the USB drive you copied the 6gb image to. A window should pop up showing the contents of the drive. Take note of where its mounted. It should be /Devices/Yourdrivesvolumename
6. Open a terminal window and cd to that directory (/Devices/Yourdrivesvolumename). Do an ?¢?Ç¨?ìls?¢?Ç¨? to make sure you are in the right place (you should see the 6gb img file.
7. In the terminal window type:
dd bs=1048576 if=./tiger-x86-flat.img of=/dev/hda
Replace hda with the correct drive! If you only have one drive, its probably hda. Thats what mine was. You are about to erase this entire drive so make sure youve got it right and make sure you want to do this! Hit enter. It takes a while?¢?Ç¨¬¶ took my vaio about 9 minutes.
8. When it?¢?Ç¨?Ñ¢s done, remove the ubuntu disc and shut down the pc. Disconnect your usb drive. Thats it! When you power it back on, OS X should boot!
For whatever reason, mine hangs when its loading. If this happens to you, boot with the -x option (hit a button at the darwin screen when you boot your pc. enter ?¢?Ç¨?ì-x?¢?Ç¨? and hit enter). Should work without any problems, and I dont see any restrictions being in safe mode.
You?¢?Ç¨?Ñ¢ll notice there is a login screen, and you dont know the password! This image was created by ?¢?Ç¨?ìdeadmoo?¢?Ç¨? and we can easily change his password. Reboot the machine again. Again, hit a button at the darwin screen. This time type ?¢?Ç¨?ì-v?¢?Ç¨? and hit enter. At the command prompt screen type:
sh /bin/sh?passwd curtis?(change the password to what you like)?passwd deadmoo?(change the passwrod to what you like)
Done! Now reboot once more, and again use the ?¢?Ç¨?ì-x?¢?Ç¨? option. Everything should boot, and at the login screen enter your new password.
WELCOME TO THE OS X x86 CLUB! Look ma, no vmware!
Note: If you are installing this in a PC and have multiple drives, you dont need to use an external drive or linux distro. Simply dd the image in the same manner to any physical drive in your pc, and when its done boot to that drive and it should work. For windows users, there is a port of dd for windows you can use here.
I messed around with this in vmware before installing natively, and I can tell you running it native is a million times faster! Its full speed. USB works, ethernet works, all the x86 software works. Enjoy!</blockquote>]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Posting this reply from a machine that succumbed easily to these directions.  This machine seems very well suited to this operation as at least the wired ethernet is working properly.  But a couple of hints:
1) the external USB drive (either FAT or FAT32) didn't work as there's a 2GB file size limit.  I had to untar it to an ext3 drive and then copy it to an HFS+ external drive.  I could have expanded it to the HFS+ drive directly...  Ubuntu includes HFS+ read/write support so that worked well.  
2) my drive was NOT hda so I needed to 'fdisk -l' to discover that I needed to dd to /dev/sda
3) I didn't have to do any of the Darwin boot options to change the password.  It automatically logged in on boot and then using the password 'bovinity' I created myself as an admin user, logged out of deadmoo and logged back in as myself and deleted deadmoo
4) OS X is far to speedy on this Celeron M 1.3 MHz.  I don't have it burdened down with all sorts of apps running simultaneously, but it makes my 1.25 GHz G4 feel 'old']]></wp:comment_content>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[So Madge and I recently moved up to the world of the cell phone.  I rather hate cell phones but love the principle behind SMS (txt).  

I think my hatred stems from how they seem to always take precedence over face-to-face conversations or situations.  I dislike most any "interrupt-based" system (except in software).  I much prefer the time-shifting capabilities of SMS.  Messages are sent with the knowledge that I might not see it <em>immediately</em> and they're usually terse enough to not burn up my minutes with idle chit-chat.  I'm trying to be frugal, and SMS's are the best communication value for the doller that I've found thusfar.  So don't expect me to answer if you give me a voice call.  (And I won't check my voicemail from the phone either - as that burns up $$$ too - if I think its urgent, I might, otherwise I'll wait 'till I can use a free landline to listen to the voicemail.)

But I'm digressing.
 
The phones themselves weren't cheap, but I told myself long ago that I wouldn't get one unless it did what I wanted.  I can put any ringtone on it that I want without having to buy them from the carrier as the phones have bluetooth and integrate super-nice with our two bluetooth Macs.  And a side perk is they *can* take pictures.  Note to self, however, the "4x zoom" just means "ineffective crop".  This is one of the non-zoomed images that Madge took of me and the girls last night at the playground.  <img alt="28-08-05_1924" src="http://www.skipandmadge.com/movies/28-08-05_1924.jpg" width="480" height="360" />

On <a href='http://www.tuaw.com/'>The Unofficial Apple Weblog</a> I saw mentioned an open-source iPhoto plugin that lets you upload pictures from iPhoto directly to your weblog.  So the base of this post was made using the <a href='http://www.daikini.com/photon/'>Photon iPhoto plugin</a>.  It does what its advertised to do but well, this post was originally <em>just</em> a picture and the post was titled with the name of the picture.  Unfortunately, I can do the same (and more) by using <a href='http://ecto.kung-foo.tv/'>ecto</a>, as it can read the iPhoto library and post whatever pictures I want.

I'm sure someone can hack the code (now that its GPL'd) so that you can post a complete gallery with a custom Title and other text.  I personally would like to use this as a base for other iPhoto plugins.  The action-code of a plugin wouldn't be tough for me to write, but figuring out how to get iPhoto to recognize the plugin (writing the "plugin" part) seems a little tough for me.

One day I'll code in Cocoa again.  One day...]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hi, I think you're a pretty smart guy so I'm just going to give you an idea. Wanna know how I've been raking in $700 a week EVERY week for the last 5 months? Buying from here: http://bidandwinbig.info and selling it right back on ebay :-). Usually, I don't even need to spend any money out of pocket because I sell on ebay before I have to pay hahah! You should check it out, you can get ipads, unlocked iphones and all those new phones for about $20-$50 if you play it smart. Always bid at night and don' let greed get the better of you. Good luck!]]></wp:comment_content>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[You need to create a .htaccess file in your root WordPress directory. Text edit and bbedit won't let you create files that begin with a period. What I did was search on my system for .htaccess files (you need to search for invisible files). Then make a copy of an htaccess file to your root wp directory. Open up terminal
<code>cd /library/web server/documents/path-to-your-wp-directory/
touch .htaccess
chmod 666 .htaccess</code>

Open up the now writeable htaccess file with bbedit, and delete anything thats already in it.

Add/change these lines to your <code>httpd.conf</code> file. First you'll have to change the permissions on this too to write to it. (I also changed the AllowOverride for the "/" directory to All, not sure if this is needed)
<code>&lt;directory "/"&gt;
Options FollowSymLinks
AllowOverride All
&lt;/directory&gt;
</code>

Then  in the <code>sites/</code> directory modify the site-specific <code>.conf</code>
<code>&lt;directory "/path/to/your/wp-directory/"&gt;
Options FollowSymLinks
AllowOverride All
Order allow,deny
Allow from all
&lt;/directory&gt;</code>

Save it (first you have to change the permissions so you have access).

Restart apache from terminal with
<code>sudo apachectl graceful</code>

Go into Wordpress and set up your permalinks and copy the settings to the .htaccess file.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[So ends the longest drought since I first started blogging 3.5 years ago.  I moved my server, then swapped servers and ended up having a few months of DNS problems.  My regular DNS hosts have now been updated and i'm toying with swapping over to the <a href="https://www.xname.org/index.php">Free DNS hosting provided by xname.org</a> so I can make any necessary changes, additions, or adjustments myself.

In the meantime I've had many things I've wanted to say and I've even drafted a few that I should now be willing to post.  I've also upgraded to <a href="http://wordpress.org/development/2005/12/wp2/">WordPress 2.0</a> and have <a href="http://akismet.com/">Akismet</a> working to protect me from comment-spam.

All I need now is more PC-100 (or PC-133) memory for my webserver, time to tweak my theme to add some nifty features, and time to go about getting my <a href="http://www.skipandmadge.com/?p=116">CJSW recording/podcasting</a> running again.  ]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[For a long time I've been wanting to document software that I regularly use all the time and honestly couldn't live without.  These choices can extend beyond my preferred platform, so I've created a new category, Choice Compiled Code, which I'll post each favorite under.

Its possible that I'll post potential favorites here as well - software that I either want to check out or software that I've started using but that I'm not fully committed to yet.

But initially I'll list one that I've used for several years.  It may not have been updated recently, but I've found no show-stopping bugs either.

So my first pick goes to <a href="http://rsug.itd.umich.edu/software/fugu/">Fugu</a>.  I enjoy doing file transfers from the command line, but this free, open-source, graphical SSH, SCP, SFTP program allows me to create bookmarks and can store passwords in the OS X Keychain.  ]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I found this information very useful a couple of months ago and wanted to repost it lest the original source disappear.

<blockquote>I've just sorted this one out myself. It seems PHP and MySQL don't communicate properly out of the box using Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger Server. Here's what to do:

1. Fire up MySQL Manager (Applications/Server/MySQL Manager) and ensure MySQL is installed. Also double check the PHP4 module is enabled in your Apache settings. If it isn't, enable it and restart the service.

2. Start up MySQL. We need to ensure that a particular SQL directory is created so we can tweak it later on.

3. Open Terminal and type sudo cp /etc/php.ini.default /etc/php.ini

4. Open /etc.php.ini in your a text editor and add /var/mysql as the default MySQL socket. It should read:
mysql.default_socket = /var/mysql/mysql.sock
5. PHP should now know where to look. Make sure the directory can be read: sudo chmod 755 /var/mysql and close your text editor.

6. Type mysql -h localhost -u root -p and enter the root password.

7. Replacing the coloured text with your own choices, at the MySQL prompt, type:
CREATE DATABASE wordpress;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON wordpress.* TO word@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
SET PASSWORD FOR word@localhost = OLD_PASSWORD('password');
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
8. Point your browser to http://localhost/wordpress/wp-admin/install.php (or wherever install.php resides in WebServer/Documents). Finally, hit return and pray.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Beyond just posting about interesting software that I'm interested in or can't live without, I also like food.  Actually, if I could typically go without eating, I would.  But, when I'm interested in food, I quite enjoy it and especially enjoy food of quality, not necessarily quantity.
So here's a recipe that I found on the Internet (via <a href='http://www.slashfood.com/2005/10/04/food-porn-nigellas-chocolate-brownies/'>slashfood</a>), that Madge first made, and that I've now made once (with pointers from Madge).  These are, according to my tastes, very good brownies.  I'd say that they're "the best ever" but that's a tough judgement call until I've tried every brownie recipe in existance.  These are definitely a contender.  And I expect Nigella is <a href='http://www.nigella.com/'>Nigella Lawson</a>.

<h4>Nigella's Brownies</h4>

1 2/3 cup soft unsalted butter ?É¬¢?¢?Äö¬¨?Ç¬®
13 ounces (368.5 grams) of very fine chocolate (I used Lindt 70% Cocoa Chocolate - each bar is 100g, and some Chipits chocolate chips)?É¬¢?¢?Äö¬¨?Ç¬®
6 large eggs?É¬¢?¢?Äö¬¨?Ç¬®
1 tablespoon vanilla?É¬¢?¢?Äö¬¨?Ç¬®
1 2/3 cup sugar?É¬¢?¢?Äö¬¨?Ç¬®
1 1/2 cup all purpose flour?É¬¢?¢?Äö¬¨?Ç¬®
1 teaspoon salt?É¬¢?¢?Äö¬¨?Ç¬®
1 1/3 cup chopped <strike>walnuts</strike> pecans (I'd say optional)

?É¬¢?¢?Äö¬¨?Ç¬®?É¬¢?¢?Äö¬¨?Ç¬®Preheat the oven to 350?É?Äö?Ç¬?F. 
Line your brownie pan (13x9") with parchment paper. This is a little extra step but makes the brownie a breeze to get out of the pan....?É¬¢?¢?Äö¬¨?Ç¬®?É¬¢?¢?Äö¬¨?Ç¬®Melt the butter and chocolate together over medium-low heat. Let this cool a bit after melting. 
Mix together the eggs, sugar and vanilla in a large bowl. 
Measure the flour into another bowl along with the salt. (I used a 2 cup measuring cup and then added the salt directly to the measuring cup and stirred.)

Mix together the cooled chocolate/butter mixture and the eggs/sugar mixture. Add in the nuts (I didn't - I left them out). Mix in the flour and beat to combine smoothly and scrape into lined pan.?É¬¢?¢?Äö¬¨?Ç¬®?É¬¢?¢?Äö¬¨?Ç¬®Bake for 25 (35-40?) minutes and be vigilant. Brownies can go from delish to dry in about 2 minutes.... They will continue to cook a bit as they cool....

25 minutes just wasn't long enough.  I ended up baking them for closer to 35-40 - until a knife could be inserted in the center and the batter would <em>just barely</em> cling.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[During our time in San Diego a couple (and their daughter) quickly befriended us, and gave us the opportunity to go surfing a couple of times. We always had lots of fun together and had a lot in common.  

After one dinner party (or other outing) the topic of desserts came up and they said they knew one of the best, richest, most delicate, dark chocolate desserts.  Naturally we had to  schedule a follow-up dinner party during which we made these.

Thanks to Cameron and Lisa for introducing us to this one (and their hospitality).  Now I just need to document the rules to their addictive dice game.

<h4>Warm Chocolate Molten Cake</h4>
Serves 4

5 oz bittersweet <strike>or semisweet</strike> chocolate chopped (145 g)
1/4 cup (1/2 stick) unsalted butter
1 tablespoon brandy (or 1 tsp rum flavoring)
2 large eggs
2 large egg yolks
5 tablespoons sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
Large pinche of salt (+1/8 tsp cinnamon)
1 tablespoon all purpose flour
1/2 cup chilled whipping cream
1/2 package frozen raspberries

Method for the Cake:
Generously butter four 3/4-cup souffl?É?í?Ç¬© dishes or custard cups (ramekins to the cool kids). No flour or sugar.  
Arrange on baking sheet.
Stir chocolate and butter in heavy small saucepan over low heat until smooth.
Remove from heat; stir in brandy (rum).  Cool 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Using electric mixer, beat eggs, yolks, 4 tablespoons sugar, vanilla, cinnamon, and salt in medium bowl (about 6 minutes)
Sift flour over batter; fold in flour.  Fold batter in chocolate mixture
Divide batter among dishes, filling completely.  Can refrigerate up to 24 hours.
Preheat over to 400?É?Äö?Ç¬?F.  Bake cakes until tops are puffed (about 15 minutes).
Cool cakes 5 minutes before turning (inverting) onto plates and serving with the following:

Raspberry Coulis:
De-frost raspberries and puree with 1 tablespoon of sugar.
Pass through a sieve or cheesecloth to remove any seeds.
Ladle sauce onto a plate and center a cake in the pool of sauce.
Garnish with Confectioners sugar (icing sugar, powdered sugar) (optional) and serve with whipped cream.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I need a way to archive email but still have it completely accessible for the future.  I'd like to be able to pull all my old work email off our exchange server (and its corresponding .pst local archive) and export it (through Apple's Mail.app) to some format that I can read regardless of platform.

I haven't figured out a way yet, but this might help.
<a href="http://www.mailsteward.com/">Mail Steward</a>.

It can export all the data (what about attachments?) to an SQL file or tab-deliminated text (among other formats).  I'll have to give it a shot.]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[It sounds like you would like to archive your emails for your own future use, and not for of compliance related issues.

Most email archiving solutions would require access to your exchange environment in order to capture each email with the log file as proof of authenticity.

If your requirement is solely for own use, and not compliance there are less expensive ways of achieving this, such as forwarding all incoming and outgoing mails to a 3rd party mail system (such as gmail) for archiving and search purposes

<content:encoded><![CDATA[man pages are the unix word's manuals for how to do anything.  If you happen to know the name of a command, but don't know how to use it, typing <code>man <em>command</em></code> in the terminal will bring up the manual for that command.  There are a bunch of shortcut keys that you can then use to move forward and backward and to search the man page, but these aren't obvious and I personally only know the basics.

If you're not forced to do all your work in the terminal, a very handy app <a href="http://www.bruji.com/bwana/">Bwana</a> will allow you to browse man pages inside Safari.  

All you have to do is <a href="http://www.bruji.com/bwana/bwana.dmg">download Bwana</a> and then you don't even have to launch the app.  I'm not certain how its been done but all you do now is type <code>man:<em>command</em></code> in Safari's addressbar and Bwana will do the rest.  Bwana will automatically convert the man pages to HTML and show it in your Safari* window.  Click on a link to another man page and the new page will show up.  Bwana doesn't even show up in the dock.  

And its FREE!

Makes me wonder what other tools could be activated in safari's addressbar.  An AJAX version of ssh/scp/sftp?

Now the only thing left is learning the terminal command that matches the action you want/need to take in the first place.

*Also works in Firefox, Internet Explorer or Camino.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Most of all I dislike Windows.  I really hope that Vista is a good upgrade because I find it deplorable that 90% of the computing world is <em>stuck</em> using something that I find so frustrating.  

I dislike the mouse acceleration. I dislike the settings windows that layer upon each other in a modal fashion, but aren't accessible via the Taskbar and are easily lost under all the other windows.  I'm confused as to why, when I select "Shutdown" and I have Outlook open, I get a modal window telling me that I have to quit all Microsoft Office applications before I can shut down.  Sometimes (I forget the use-case) the "kill" dialog appears saying that the application will be terminated in <em>X</em> number of seconds.  And then there are two buttons you can click to "Quit" or "Cancel", and neither option intuitively conveys the result.  

Its too bad that the world has been stuck with such a poor platform.  The hard-drive Explorer <em>is</em> the Internet explorer.  Yes, you can explore both items with the same program, so I see <em>why</em> they did it, but honestly it was a poor decision.  We are left with legions of people who have no concept of their hard-drive hierarchy (and hence fine "the computer" baffling) because the html/url content of the internet has been so confusingly mixed with file-locations.

And then there's the whole hard-drive hierarchy as visually represented in Explorer.  Honestly, Microsoft doesn't want to help people understand how their machine works (where their files are REALLY stored) they want to obfuscate the real location so that people don't <em>have</em> to know.  Fine, if you really think that's simpler.  But what does that do to people's perceptions when, though Desktop is shown at the top of the hierarchy, you can navigate to the same location on the hard drive via C:/Documents and Settings/username/Desktop ?  

Programs can install themselves and hijack the Start menus, Quick Launch area, and Open With menu, but users <em>have</em> to have these areas hidden from them, inaccessible unless they know more about "the computer" than the user interface teaches them?

People stuck with Monitors flickering at 60 Hz, hurting their eyes without them knowing why?  Why?  Because the control for changing the refresh rate is buried under an "Advanced..." button's modal window full of tabs with obscure names.  Do people really need to change that setting as often as they check their video driver version/parameters/IO range?  That's what this setting is associated with by its location in the UI.  Its so wrong.  

Its not enabling.  That's why I dislike windows.  I don't think its the best way to represent the operational abilities of a computer.  I think its designed in a manner to obfuscate the paradigms upon which it is constructed.  I think that, yes, people don't need to understand all the underlying intricacies, but people should be able to understand the basic concepts <em>if</em> they are represented in an intuitively logical manner.  

That's why the GUI has persisted for more than 20 years as the interface of choice (well, a little less than that in the Windows world).  Power users use the command line, but who uses DOS these days?  People use the graphical user interface in most instances because <em>it makes the most sense</em>.  No other paradigm makes sense to the average person.  Those who understand the underlying concepts can be at home on the CLI (Command Line Interface), but people who think that Desktop is the "root" (base) of their computer would be (and are) horribly confused when they open the Windows command line, <code>cmd</code>, and try to do anything (other than run ipconfig).

I work with technical people.  They understand how radio frequency (RF) communication works.  They understand the technical details that are far beyond my understanding.  But they don't understand how to use their computer (no offense intended).  There's a set of operations that they use every day that work for them, but when things go awry, they're completely lost.  And I don't blame the users, I blame the designers of the interface they're forced to use.  This horrible interface is, unfortunately, the best that is available to them, and for this reason I hope Vista is an improvement, and not just further obfuscations and eye-candy.

So with this introduction, I'll continue onward with my intended topic.  Linux. 

I love linux.  It lets me do things in a way that Windows doesn't allow (or is inconvenient in Windows). 

I recently acquired a new laptop at work.  Its an LG LM70 Express.  A slick, thin, powerful, well designed laptop who's only deficiencies are a really poor LCD and no built-in option for bluetooth.  

The LCD is not the now-normal "widescreen" aspect ratio, and the color clarity and "evenness" of the pixels is despicable.  Any solid color on the screen is not a homogenous "blue" or "white" but a heterogeneous amalgam of shades of blue or grey.  Every pixel is a different shade of the intended color.  

And I'm not used to the keyboard layout, but that's inconsequential.

I use Windows when I have to.  I go out of my way to use OS X or Linux if at all possible, so as not to have my frustrations with Windows affect my daily outlook and attitude.  It <em>really</em> bothers me that much, probably because I know there's a <em>better</em> way.  I have no problem with other people enjoying Windows, until I'm forced to help people who wouldn't need help if the system they're stuck using wasn't so disabling.

So with the transition to a new laptop comes the necessity of three things.

1) Resize the NTFS (Windows) partition on the hard drive so I can install Linux on half of the hard drive and use either Windows or Linux.  
2) Install Linux - Ubuntu is my Linux distribution of choice.
3) Install all the Linux apps I need and get everything configured as needed to be productive.  Ubuntu is great at getting most things setup right from the start, but there are <em>always</em> things I need to tweak.

I decided to try out the preview version of the next version of Ubuntu (Breezy Badger is the name of the next version - due out in a couple of weeks).  It is supposed to have the capability of resizing a Windows partition during the installation process so that it can automatically convert a Windows-only machine into a Windows/Linux machine without the need of reinstalling Windows or losing any data.  But, being a preview, this function didn't work on my specific laptop.  I can't completely fault Ubuntu, as this LM70 with a fairly new chipset, no cardbus slot (just ExpressCard) and a SATA hard drive.  Other Linux LiveCD's wouldn't boot my machine, so I must be near the bleeding edge.

It's actually been some time since I started writing this and honestly can't remember what all I had to do to get Ubuntu running on the LM70.  Either way, I much prefer Linux to Windows (Linux warts and all).  But I dislike Windows, and really hope for all those (poor?) Windows users that Vista is better.  Unfortunatly, I think some of the fundamental User Interface design principles are what disturb me, and that they will still be an disagreeable part of Vista.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Ok, none of the various computers I use at work or at home are named Nemo.  I've tried to name my computers, but I guess I'm not apt to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropomorphism">anthropomorphize</a>. 

Or, perhaps I just fill my life with too many dumb computers to truly enjoy any of them to the point of naming them.  Recently I think I had 9 laptops in my cubicle and two desktops.  Really I only use three machines.  I take my 1.25 GHz Mac Powerbook with me most everywhere I go.  Its my preferred computing tool and preferred OS.  I also have a 2 year old Dell D800 and a 4 month old LG LM70.  Both machines I've made dual-boot Windows and Ubuntu Linux.

My trouble is that I want to VPN into the office network from home or when travelling and have difficulty discovering these machines.  So these are just some notes as to how I can potentially discover a machine.

avahi-publish-service "Desktop SSH" _ssh._tcp 22


http://avahi.org/wiki/Avah4users
http://www.google.com/search?q=avahi+publish+ssh+service&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;start=10&amp;sa=N
http://www.livejournal.com/community/evan_tech/153727.html

http://www.tildesoft.com/Programs.html


Or just try http://ettercap.sourceforge.net/index.php until I find a MAC address that I know, or is there some way to search a network for a MAC address and find out its IP

Or try building 
http://angst.sourceforge.net/
using 
http://libpcap.darwinports.com/ 
and
http://libnet.darwinports.com/
Built it but not sure if its working...

Try http://freequaos.host.sk/arpwatch/ instead
looks like arpwatch (the original version) is in darwinports http://arpwatch.darwinports.com/

or could try http://www.sc.isc.tohoku.ac.jp/~hgot/sources/trackpeer.html]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Apart from having coworkers attempt to refer to me as AL (always late) I've also been horrible about expressing myself by way of this site.  Its a sad, typical statement, but I've been busy.

Riding home (aka. to the hotel) on the train in Korea seems to be the first chance I've had to indulge in some one-sided communication.

As a general reminder, I should, in the following days, write about
<ul>
<li>The circumstances of the trip (everything that came together and everything I'm missing)</li>
<li>World Cup in Korea</li>
<li>Visiting the DMZ</li>
<li>"All my children"</li>
<li>Sushi!!! (o-sho)</li>
<li>and more that I can't recall at the moment...</li>
</ul>

The trip has been great thusfar.  A bit less work perhaps than other instances.  The company has been great and I've been able to work on a nifty little python program for pouring through datasets and making information more presentable (easier to interpret with less work).

Now I just need to figure out how to wrap a gui on it and distribute it for OS X and Windows.

I'll be the only one here from the company starting tomorrow - so hopefully everything works out well with the plan for the rest of the week.

I'm also hoping to publish some things I've started writing (but never completed) months ago.  Hopefully the flurry of activity will set a new trend.

I also should take the time to post some galleries of pictures.

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[So I've known for a long time that my company would be introducing a new product into production some time this summer season, but not specifically when.  Of my group, I made the last trip to Korea - to help introduce a product of which  I wasn't involved in the design.

So when this product, of which I was deeply involved, was coming up for a pre-production run in Korea at the end of June, I didn't much want to go and feared that I would be the one to get asked.

That was, until I learned more of the circumstances of the world around me.  You see, the last time I came to Korea, I swore that the <em>next</em> time I would make use of the opportunity and travel to neighbouring Bejing and visit my brother-in-law (whom I've know longer than Madge).  Well, Mennipus was going to be travelling back to Canada around the same time as the possible trip to Korea, but he would be returning to Bejing sooner than his wife and there was a <em>slight</em> possibility that he'd be back in Bejing before I needed to leave Korea.

Some quick emails and calendar examination later showed that if I managed to both delay and extend a trip to Korea, I could fly into Bejing the same day as Mennipus.  

So I volunteered for the job.  Everyone at work was surprised that I signed up and I openly stated my reasoning, intentions, and that I figured that due to the nature of the product and my involvement, that I likely would have been asked (to which I was told that my Manager didn't have anyone specifically in mind).

And then it struck me.  My brother Jon had been talking of travelling (to Cuba) but has also had an interested in cultural "specialties" of China and North Korea.  So I invited him to come along.

So 11 days after leaving for Seoul, we're now leaving for a week in Bejing.  This will have been a pretty long trip away from home - almost three weeks.  I most certainly owe Madge for the opportunity - especially given that I'll be hanging out with her brother, whom she misses and would love to spend more time with.  

The trip hasn't been without sacrifices (for her or me).  About two months ago I started training to run in a 10K road race on July 1 in my home town.  I've been mixing biking to work with twice-weekly lunchtime soccer games, and once a week runs home from work (approx. 8K).  I'd hoped to do 10K in under 45 minutes and was well on my way to doing so.  I would also be missing World Cup and the first 10 days of the Tour de France ?¢?Ç¨?Äú two sporting events both Madge and I look forward to enjoying together.  I would also miss my 1st of July hometown celebration - specifically sharing the quaint parade with my two little girls and visiting with my family.

But now Isopraxis and I have seen many of the sights of Seoul.  I was obligated to work for all except two days - but we made the most of those.  Look for future posts to describe our exploration of Seoul and its surroundings.

So now for another cultural shift and off to the "madness" of Bejing.  I've been to China twice before, but this will be my first visit to someplace other than Hong Kong/Dongguan/Shenzen.

But the rather fortunate part is how well this whole trip has come together - despite the sacrifices involved.  Its had been fortuitous that I both delayed my arrival (vs. the others from work who came as well), and that I stayed longer.  I was able to ensure proper testing completion and shipment of all produced units.  Along the way I've written a tool to parse through testing-results files and was able to use this to give my counterparts of the manufacturing facility a breakdown of all the testing-failures encountered.  

I was also able to meet up once again (for the third time out of three trips) with my University friend Eric (who is from Korea and now lives in Seoul).  We went out for a great Korean BBQ and then made a trip on the tram up Namsang peak to Seoul Tower.  The only time he gets out to see interesting stuff in Seoul is when I come into town! :)  (Next time I want to go with him to Panjegumon (sp?) where the Korean War Armistice was negotiated and signed.

And I <em>have</em><em> to send him both the pictures from this and my last trip (and somehow find my old pictures from my first trip).</em>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Bejing? 

Dirty.

Dirty and dirty,
more, and more dirty.

The air is dirty
the sky is dirty
the buildings and people and cars are dirty.
Everything is dirty.

Dirty dirt, dust, soot and dirt
Fumes, pollutants, irritants and dirt
Dust and sand and grit...

Sweat and grit, mixing and burning.

Eyes burning. Lungs burning.
Burning, burning.

Short of breath - can't escape it.
Cannot breathe.  Suffocating.

Aching
Nausea
Dirty
Burning

Ancient places - dirty, grimey.
Picturesque view - grey and bleak
Hot, sweaty, humid, moist
Musty, dirty, rotting, dirty

Throngs and throngs, 
Hassles and throngs.
Broken-english, persistent, intrusive.
Ever-present annoyance

More and more and more to see.
All the same - grey and dirty.
Grimey and dirty and smelly and awful.
Unique, special, amazing - but awful.

Funny how it changes your mood,
Makes you ill
Makes you move.

Back to the cleanliness
Air and room
Takes an hour, or more and more
Better than swelter, ozone, monoxide
Recovery - repeat?]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Went to <em>The Wall</em> today.  It was a blessedly wonderful day.

The winds must have changed as the air was much clearer, even in the heart of the city.  Our english speaking driver took us the scenic route to the part of The Wall he said was the best.

Naturally the drive was, well, Chinese.  No other driving I've seen yet matches the uniqueness of being driven in China.

We almost hit a cyclist - an older woman who decided to ride across the road without looking.  <em>Luckily</em> our driver swerved into the oncoming lane of traffic to miss her.  I'm not sure why he didn't swerve to the right...

And on we drove towards clearer air, and mountains that came into view.

We arrived at a section of the wall <em>only</em> 640 years old.  It is flanked by older sections and we walked almost all of the younger portion.  

It was amazing.  Unique and like nothing I've seen before or will see in the future.  

Off in the distance you can see it wind across the tops of the mountain range.  On the most incredible precipices it continues to wander with outposts every 100 meters or so.  Regardless of the steepness of the hillside it climbs.  Steep, steep steps. 

We climbed and walked and climbed and descended.  The sun beat down and we enjoyed it.  The air was fresh and clear and clean(er?).  The breeze through the parapets was refreshing.  

It was nice - I'd go again.  

And then we descended on an alpine slide.  In my youth I'd seen the Sesame Street  closing with an adult and child gliding down an alpine slide.  I've always wanted to ride one and now I have.

It was great fun - I love things like that.  My brother slid faster and caught me.  But I was enjoying it and not poking along.  I enjoyed the curves and their acceleration.

At each major corner an "attendant" of sorts, stood or sat with a megaphone and shouted out "slow down".  Given that this is China, I'm sure people have been hurt.  You likely don't have much recourse, and there's no specific protective mechanism, so I appreciate that they at least have guards on watch for the spills.

Back down the hill and line of market-huts stood, showing their wares and hoping you'll heed their calls.  Even if you pause for but a moment, to look for something new amongst the same trinkets, they attack and impede and obligate a response.  If you ask the price you receive one greatly inflated.  All the better for those unaware of the real price.  

They want you to bargain and the game's in their favour.  A cheap item they've sourced for 5 they ask 150.  You start "low" and they descend.  But they want you to go up for every amount that they descend - hence the astronomical prices.

But I held fast to my realistic price - and gave up 5 once.  She descended from 150 to 90.  Then to 80.  She wanted me to come up but I gave her my honest price and said "No thanks."  It turning to go she continued to impede me, and dropped down to 45.  I stuck to 35 and she asked me to give up 5 more.  My wallet was truly empty, and I really only wanted to get a price benchmark.  So I said no once more and turned to go.  Her neighbour - their being few other tourists around and with all the racket the first was making - came with her own, only bigger and nicer.  And offered me my asking price.

But amid the confusion I turned and escaped, but up the hill I met a bigger battle.

Mon fr?É¬®re had happened upon a Mao-printed bag.  I figured it fancied him and didn't want him fleeced.  

She started at 180 and he said 80, but I felt it was too much and hadn't arrived in time.  She agreed and I knew she was getting a good markup and I think I interjected.  He said no and we managed to escape - despite her claims that a deal had been made.

And down the hill we went to find our driver.  As we turned toward the tea-house, she shouted 40.  She evidently wanted to make the sale.  I'd already soured her by getting involved in the attempted-fleecing, but I wasn't going to let her pushy demeanour win.

So I switched to French (her English was too good), and told my brother to "Say 30".  It was obvious to me that if she would jump down to 40, that she had margin left and we had room to bargain again.  Her face turned sour as she knew I was helping.  Helping her lose in a language she couldn't follow.  But he wouldn't speak (or was just saying no), so I said it instead.

She knew she was had.  She claimed it was too low, but I knew that it wasn't.  I told her that if she'd jumped down to 40 then that wasn't too low.  And she got really bitter and told me that I was crazy and that I wasn't welcome in China and that I shouldn't ever come again.  But along the way she agreed to 30 and amid the confusion and her worked-up state, she dropped her pen and I found a wonderful opportunity to get back at her.

I quickly stooped and picked up her pen, and held it out to her with two joined hands and a bowed head.  Her ugly, disgusted, enraged face disappeared, and she momentarily smiled and embarrassed smile.  She could see I wasn't the <em>bad-nasty</em> she was accusing me to be - and I knew that I hadn't been evil in sticking my ground and asking for 30.

But once the transaction was gone, she attacked me again with the same line of words.  " You're not welcome in China! Don't back come again."

And she turned and left.  

I wanted to tell her "I love you too", but didn't.  She was gone.  

She'd shouted to save face, perhaps.  But the best was still to come.  As we turned to leave, a shop-keeper above us was smiling and clapping - we'd drawn a crowd and they were pleased with the performance.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Been weeks and weeks since I've written anything.  Since I was in China.

Much has been going on and finally I'm starting to take care of some of the smaller, day-to-day tasks which have been building up.

Hopefully I'll be able to write on a more frequent basis.  I have a build-up of posts that I'll likely post in one swoop.  Some might be incomplete thoughts, but i need to get them out.

The biggest project I've about finished (just waiting on final approval) is a video project that I shot, edited, wrote the music to, and made all the motion graphics for.  It was recently shown at a relevant conference in Scotland where it was well received.  Unfortunately, though its within my capacity to do such work, its a heavy workload to deal with "on the side."

I have other "on the side" projects which are better suited to working on at random times and places and on this notebook (as opposed to a dedicated desktop editing station).

Wish I could post the video - but I can't.

... more to come ...

<content:encoded><![CDATA[When I first went to university, I very soon had two favorite classes.  The one involved coming up with an idea - a solution to a problem - and documenting it (why, how, the solution would work, etc).  The second, was a class in TurboPascal.  I ate it up.  The language was ok, but mildly frustrating as I remember it.  I didn't have a completely clear understanding of why and how, but I found it very magical to <em>create</em>.  <em>I</em> could create - create anything I wanted or anything I could use the language to create (as languages, of all types, can easily become barriers unless you learn to properly employ them).  

I'd been timid as a child.  In<em>timid</em>ated by my peers, by my siblings, and by my surroundings.  In my own element, where I found myself somewhat in control or completely knowledgeable about the subject at hand, I could find myself at ease, but apart from at the farm, or outside the classroom, I was out of my element.  My peers, and siblings (and their offspring) found my excellence in the classroom as perhaps intimidating, or perhaps insulting or unworthy of recognition.  But if that's one of two places where you find yourself at ease, its nigh impossible to <em>stop</em> performing well.  Its not a question of impressing the right people, but, in my situation, any positive reinforcement feels wonderful.

I the business world, at least in <em>my</em> business world, I've found that excellence is rewarded, complemented, and appreciated.  As a youth it lead to hostility, insult, jealousy, contempt and disrespect.  Certainly, in the business world, these negative results can still be experienced, but I'd vouch to say that they emanate from adult bodies with insecure youths trapped inside.  

But university is a place to be tried, rewarded, insulted, and generally instilled (tuned) with knowledge, ability, and understanding.  And so I found comfort in creation.  At first it was the simple ability to <em>run a program</em> - a simple program that put words on a screen.  Any words I commanded the machine to put on the screen would be displayed (if I held to the rules - the syntax - of the language).

Yet my confidence and focus in university were battered and I let myself down.  I didn't have the faith in myself that I <em>could</em> understand if I put in enough effort.  So I didn't apply the necessary time on one lab that came back to haunt me in the final.  My marks suffered and I left "First Year" with the desire to do something different.

Two years in France gave me a chance to learn - to learn about myself, about other people, about the world, and about where I found work most enjoyable.  Again it was in front of a computer.  This time the language was different - it was data organization and representation.  Yet the task was the same - improvement.  Using the computer to improve a process, simplify, reduce labour.  

I am a machine.

I live to improve.  Improvement comes through creation.

I am creation.

So I returned to university.  I had worked, in the best and worst conditions all at the same time, in France and found confidence and ability and understanding in myself.  I found my strengths.  My patience and determination were improved.  I found faith in myself and tolerance in my surroundings and peers.  Their words would no longer stick to me.  Though they may hurt - sting for a moment - I gained resilience and confidence.

I retook classes that challenged me before and prevailed.  And I took a new programming class.

C++

Those three syllables had been ominous to the old me - something beyond my abilities or opportunities.  Like Calculus to Arithmatic, C++ to Pascal was seen, by the old me, as a higher level - a challenge that would surely be demeaning and frustrating, not something I would enjoy.

And yet, given the opportunity to receive instruction, I latched on and have not yet been filled.  Soon I found myself using language constructs the instructor did not understand or appreciate and I found myself yet again conversing with the instructor (or teacher in the more youthful days) over how I was indeed correct.

Another year of school and the language became more clear and my abilities grew.  Year over year I learned and grew and created.  Soon it was another language, and another.  Then it was how ALL languages work.  And on reaching that point, the language specifically ceased to be important, as fitting the appropriate language to the problem at hand became more fun.  Using the language that made the act of creation easier, or more enjoyable, is what happens now.

But the task is always the same.  

Solving the problem.  Creating the solution.  Improving the process.

Yet software development is a hobby - a side-project.  My skills improve in many areas, and as long as I learn and improve, I am happy.

But I do not shake this software addiction - nor do I want to.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I've been slowly transitioning how this site is hosted over the course of the past couple of weeks.  This meant that I was offline for a while, but I'm back.

A couple of years ago, back when I was in San Diego, my old reliable tower (that'd I'd slightly overclocked years before) stopped functioning properly.  I ended up ordering a BTO G5 tower - a single processor one, and it was nothing but problems for the first year - until a firmware fix came out to solve the random crashes that would occur.

In fact, dispute over the whether the machine was faulty or not has caused me to have negative memories about visiting the local Apple Store for support.  The Genius I got stuck with played a power-trip instead of listening to reason - but 9 months later Apple proved my assertions correct...  Too bad that 'Genius' likely never connected my dispute to the later firmware release.

But seriously, who ever heard of a computer spontaneously freezing because a 19" VGA CRT was used, not an Apple DVI LCD?

But this isn't what I was intending to write about.  

So the old tower that I'd written off for dead, forcing me to acquire the lemon G5, has recently been brought back to life and it seems to run great.  Its only got 128 MB of RAM and a 10GB disk, but its serving a couple of sites and running smoothly.  Another couple of drives and more memory will give me a decent backup-repository and continue serving a few pages.

But I've had an Intel Pro/1000 MT Desktop Gigabit Ethernet adapter sitting in an unused Linux firewall box for more than a year.  So I threw it in this old tower and naturally OS X didn't include a matching driver.

But from this <a href="http://support.intel.com/support/network/sb/cs-012904.htm">Intel Pro/1000 support page</a> I discovered a 3rd party source for OS X drivers for Intel.  <a href="http://www.small-tree.com/index.html">Small Tree Communications</a> appears to sell custom versions of the Intel Gigabit Ethernet Cards for OS X boxes.  I'm not sure what's special about the Small Tree ones versus the <a href="http://www.memoryexpress.com/index.php?PageTag=&amp;page=file&amp;memx_menu=EmbedProductDetail.php&amp;DisplayProductID=5942&amp;SID=">off-the-shelf-at-the-local-OEM-supply-store</a> cards, but Small Tree does have their own <a href="http://www.small-tree.com/downloads/IntelGb.htm">Gigabit Ethernet Driver for OS X</a>.  

Naturally the set of cards supported isn't listed - they likely only support the cards they sell, and my specific card wasn't even listed on the  Intel Support site (my card's Device IDs wasn't listed).  But I gave it a shot.  I installed the driver and, nope, the card didn't work.  I looked around some more and found that the cards the Small Tree driver supported used the same IntelÂ® 82541PI Gigabit Controller as found on my card.  So I figured that the only thing keeping the driver from working on my card was a <a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/DeviceDrivers/Conceptual/MassStorage/04_Matching/chapter_4_section_2.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000736-BBICIBDC">driver matching</a> failure.  I tweaked a couple of the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Darwin/Conceptual/KernelProgramming/Extend/chapter_17_section_2.html">.kext</a>'s <a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/DeviceDrivers/Conceptual/MassStorage/04_Matching/chapter_4_section_2.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000736-TPXREF101">Info.plist</a> files within the driver bundle to include my card's PCI Device and Vendor IDs and rebooted. (Note, OS X's system profiler identified my card as having a Vendor ID of 0x8086 and a Device ID of 0x1076 and the Info.plists need these in a combined format of 0x10768086 in order to match.)

Voila!  I now had gigabit ethernet working in a G4 450 tower that had been sitting abandoned for almost two years.  Two <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_card">NIC</a>s will get me a proper <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firewall_%28networking%29">firewall</a> with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vpn">VPN</a> access to my home network.  

Color this geek satisfied.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Give an active kid a hammer and what will they do?  Use it on everything in sight.

With no boundaries or rules in place, everything is subjected to the hammer's usefulness, because it is such a <em>wonderful</em> and <em>marvelous</em> <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">tool</span> toy.

<strong>Email is a hammer.
</strong>
I was on the internet for the first time back in 1995 and I had just started my university career.  It was the heady days of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pine_%28e-mail_client%29">Pine</a> (for email), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finger_protocol">Finger</a> (for finding if people were online), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_%28protocol%29">Gopher</a> (for searching), and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet">Usenet</a> (mmm... alt.caving).  Browsing the web was done only in text.  And getting "online" meant using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telnet">telnet</a> from within the school network or a dial-up connection.

One of the first friends I met in class was a fellow with a penchant for forwarding emails.  Email was this brand new toy and we were all excited to use it, though we only had each other to talk to.  (We all checked email in the same room at the same time.)  I very soon was known in class by my username, probably because we saw each others' addresses so often.

Forwarded emails became a staple of our diet.  My friend had his network of friends who would send him everything <em>they</em> received, and he on to us.  It was pretty cool and a lot of fun... for about three weeks.

After a relatively short period of time, the novelty began to wear off and these endless forwards became quite tarnished.  It became very obvious that many of the "feel good" stories were nothing more than well-crafted lies, and the threads of jokes went from poor to worse (especially the ASCII animated ones where you hold down the spacebar to achieve animation).

Years later the cycle continues, and for some it never ends.  Honestly, I don't know how people have the time (or interest) to read (and then forward) all the garbage that passes through their mailboxes.  Perhaps this is why spam is successful.  Lonely, unbusy people, enjoying the novelty of this new hammer, expecting everyone to have the time (or interest) to read whatever "feel good" scam comes their way.

Bang, Bang, Bang...  Forward, forward, forward...

Please, before you waste my (or others') time, do be considerate and research the background on the latest "hot" story to hit your inbox.  Search for it in <a href="http://www.snopes.com/">Snopes</a>, and more often than not you'll find its a hoax.  

And yes, there are legitimate articles that may be of benefit to me or to others.  Forgive me if I never read them or never respond to them.  If it doesn't interest me at that moment, chances are I'll never look at it again.  I'd much rather prefer a <em>personalized</em> communication than something you received and think I'll be interested in.  Or at <em>least</em> preface it with a personalized note and high-level synopsis.  I don't want to read 2/3 only to discover that its a complete waste of my time.  If you can sum it up in one sentence, and that sentence is appealing, I'm probably 10 times more likely to read-on.

Last but not least.  Email generally is <em>not</em> the best mechanism for distributing cool videos to your friends.  Find it on <a href="http://youtube.com/">youtube.com</a> or <a href="http://video.google.com">video.google.com</a> (or post it there) and send me a description and link.  My mailbox has a finite size, and I process (and store) a lot of email.  Please don't flood me and make legitimate messages bounce.

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[You're totally right. Email is free and easy, and therefore abused. Back in the day of snail mail, you wouldn\'t photocopy your favorite story or an interesting ad you found in the mail and send it to all your friends. To do so would cost time and money for stamps - a nice deterrant. Although, rarely, there WERE people that sent those abhorrent "chain letters" that you had to add your name at the bottom, copy and mail to 10 friends. They went along with all the warnings of "bad luck" coming to those who broke the chain. Well I, for one, broke the chain every time - and I've had pretty good luck my whole life. 

Unfortunately, email gives these (crazy?/bored?) people an easy way to play their little game - and wastes a lot of time and inbox space for the rest of us. There ARE good uses for a hammer - every house needs one, but one ought to be discriminating with its use. One man's "feel good" is another (wiser?) man's trash.]]></wp:comment_content>

I don't know...if it's not for sure, I'd like to vote "girl"...you might just have a very active girl in there!

Is the weight guess kind of like "The Price is Right?" - ie, closest guess without going over?
; )  If that's the case, I might have guessed a bit on the high side...]]></wp:comment_content>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[For all those who voted on when our baby would arrive, most of you surely didn't win.

He's hanging on inside longer than any of us expected, though we all doubt <em>he</em>'ll hold out until Monday. At least his birthday won't fall on our anniversary or Sophie's birthday.

Our midwives joke that, "It takes longer to make the handle".

<content:encoded><![CDATA[No, I'm not moving, but I finally â€“ after about a year of downtime â€“ got my podcast server running again.  

That is, I'm timeshifting CJSW so that I can listen to my favorite shows in a time-delayed fashion - subscribing to my own podcast.

Use this URL in iTunes to subscribe: <a href="feed://skip.skipandmadge.com/?feed=rss2&cat=10">feed://skip.skipandmadge.com/?feed=rss2&cat=10</a>

I'll be experimenting for the next few weeks on exactly what shows I'm going to grab as some old favorites have been replaced.

It also turns out that some of the last shows I recorded last year never got posted correctly.  I've fixed most of them and they're now available â€“ anything October 2006 or later is new.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I'm 1:27 into the first track of the new Radiohead <a href="http://www.inrainbows.com">In Rainbows</a> album and I'm in love.  (And yes, I bought this album direct from Radiohead, downloaded it direct this AM - I paid 5 GBP.)

Best band of the past two decades - bar none. 

... too bad the <a href="http://www.inrainbows.com/Store/MoreInfo.html?PID=2">DiskBox</a> is looking more attractive than ever ...]]></content:encoded>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[So I tried to install the latest RC of Parallels Desktop (5580).  Naturally the installer failed.

I'm not much of a person to accept failure, so I launched Console.app and took a look at install.log.

Quite soon it was evident that the preflight script was hanging while trying to unload/delete files that might be present from a previous install.  This was a fully clean install so the preflight had issues unloading a driver that didn't exist! (doh!)

<code>preflight[432]: grep: /Applications/Parallels/Parallels.app/Contents/Info.plist: No such file or directory
preflight[432]:
preflight[432]: /Volumes/Parallels Desktop/Install Parallels Desktop.pkg/Contents/Resources/preflight: line 82: /Library/StartupItems/Parallels/Parallels: No such file or directory
preflight[432]:
preflight[432]: kextunload: /Library/StartupItems/Parallels/Pvsvnic.kext: no such bundle file exists</code>

So I copied the installer from the disk image to my desktop, open the package and tweaked the preflight:

<code>kextunload /Library/StartupItems/Parallels/Pvsvnic.kext
sleep 1</code>

turned to
<code>#kextunload /Library/StartupItems/Parallels/Pvsvnic.kext
#sleep 1</code>

Success!!!]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I'm running either a 22K or 10K in about 6 weeks so I need to train up for it.  I'm not in horrible shape but I haven't been as intense over the summer as summers past.  Now its time to change.

Here are some notes from a 10K I did at lunch.

10K run Aug 19, 2008

Started from Novatel office, first 1 KM was tight and slow at 5:30
After coming down the hill felt good and set pace 5:00 @ 170 bpm
Listening to Portishead album Third.  Good accompanyment

Decided at 3 km to do full 10 k (Split rock flat route) as felt good
At 5 km left knee started to hurt and be sore as climbed hill from Nose Creek valley through split rock
At 7 km legs started to tighten up.
At 8 km left knee started feeling better and legs felt better, but slowed off pace to 5:25
At 9 km pushed back up to 5:00 for 1/2 a km.  Felt good but at slow pack.

Plan
Soccer tomorrow, long slow run the next day
Or hills and sprints

Long run on Saturday morning from 6:00 to 8:00

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Set out to do a "recovery" run.  Figured out that for a maximum 192 bpm heart rate:
<ul>
<li>VO2 Max (Maximum Effort) 192 - 173 bpm</li>
<li>Anaerobic (Hardcore Training) 173 - 154 bpm</li>
<li>Aerobic (Cardio Training / Endurance) 154 - 134 bpm</li>
<li>Weight Control (Fitness / Fat Burn) 134 - 115 bpm</li>
<li>Moderate Activity (Maintenance /Warm Up) 115 - 96 bpm</li>
</ul>

These were calculated using 10% ranges of my maximum bpm.  There are other calculation mechanisms, though the feeling within the top three ranges is about right.

So I ran trying to stay in the Aerobic range the entire time.  I ended up walking up some hills to keep my heart rate down.  Running back to the office with the brisk wind of a storm at my back felt great.  I think I was able to run at a better pace but still at the same heart rate.  I'll need to track my run-at-specific-heart-rate 10K time to see if it shifts over the next few weeks.

At about 8.5 k my butt was feeling sore.  For all the biking/soccer/running of the past few days my legs felt pretty good.  My left knee was still a bit sore but icing it and keeping the intensity of my runs down should help things start feeling better.

Weight at start of run: 172 lbs
Weight at end of run: 170 lbs]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Played 4 on 4 soccer.  Left knee had fluid under the bottom of the kneecap from running yesterday.  Knee was a bit tender until I warmed up.  Even then I was careful about it.  My watch said I ran just over 3 km during the 45 minute match.

Tried to take it easy.  Could still sprint and felt ok but generally my legs felt empty from the hard run yesterday.

Iced my knee at night.  Swelling/fluid went down and felt good the next morning. ]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[So I've done this blog thing, off more than on, since July 2002. 

July 2002 was the summer I got a job working for a software startup on the U of C campus after being laid off from gig as an internship student. 

Originally I used it to voice opinions, list neat things I discovered or figures out, as a memo pad for my own future reference, and as a public diary of family events and happenings. 

Turns out I'm not willing to dedicate the time each day/week/month to actually make updates. Mostly the site gets used as a repository of time-shifted radio podcasts as my way of discovering new music on my own schedule. 

So what do I want this to become?  I guess I'll have to decide or forever this will languish. Mostly it seems to be for introspection. A spot to vent and explain myself no to one in particular. Presumably this will help me understand myself better? 

I'd say more about day-to-day happenings, but some stuff I want to keep private, and other things I can't really talk about because they are work-related. It was nice to get a "why blog" reminder from papahashi.blogspot.com. 

I started this for a reason, and that reason really hasn't ever gone away. (And being able to blog from my phone eliminates most other excuses about "inconvenient" etc. I should do this instead of Sol Free solitare. )

<content:encoded><![CDATA[For the past several weeks the kids have been taking turns being sick. Mostly Erik has had a runny nose and cough, but Rhys and Soph have had their turns being fevered, throwing up, and trying to recouperate.

It will be nice when everyone us feeling better and the weather is nice. 

Just need it to rain instead of the impending snow.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[It's been beautiful weather the past few days. Today it was better than 20 C. But we need rain.  

Rhys, Erik and I went to the playground. Rhys makes friends wherever he goes. A mom was being a "monster" to her daughter and soon Rhys was chasing the "mean monster" and hugging her legs. When they left, he went to the gap in the fence and waved. 

Erik, however, is afraid of the grass.

<title>Planes, trains but no automobules</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[As Brenda, the kids and I left for the Calgary airport it was a badly-needed, heavy spring rain. Shortly after boarding the plane the rain turned to thick, heavy snow. Because of the snow, we had to wait for our turn to get de-iced. It took so long to get de-iced and the snow was so heavy that we needed a second de-icing. 45-55 minutes had already passed. We waited another 30 minutes to get de-iced the second time  Finally the process was over and we started to move. 2 hours and 15 minutes later than scheduled we finally taxied to the runway and departed. 

I had booked a train ticket to Karlsruhe from the Frankfurt airport. The train was scheduled to leave at 13:54. The flight was originally scheduled to arrive at 11:20, but with a 2:10 delay I didn't expect to arrive until 13:30, leaving 25 minutes to deplane and collect my single piece of baggage. 

Leaving the plane at 13:35 I hurried through immigration and was the first person to the luggage turnstile. The priority bags started arriving just as I did, but by then it was 13:50. 15 minutes later my bag was the first non-priority bag to arrive (a 10 minute break between priority and non). I grabbed my bag and hurried to the train station, a 2 minute walk.  I knew I had missed my train before confirming it by looking at the departure board. A few minutes later (14:11) I had paid 28€ and was scheduled to take a 14:51 train to Mannheim where I had 12 minutes to switch platforms and take a second train to Karlsruhe. 

After waiting on the platform for 45 minutes the departure board on the platform was updated. The train to Mannheim was delayed by 45 minutes and would make me miss my connection. 

Up the escalator I confirmed that I could take a direct train to Karlsruhe at 15:54, and that my updated ticket was an open ticket that required no further changes. 

So a 2 hour delay in Calgary has propagated into a second 2 hour delay in Frankfurt. We'll see how things go once I get to Karlsruhe.

 "Fun!"

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Now I'm on the train. It seems to have been oversold to people like me without a reservation. All the seats appear to be reserved and full (a red LCD shows between which cities the seat is reserved). I get to stand in the entryway for the 1 hour ride to Karlsruhe with about 10-15 other people. On a straightaway the train gets up to 200km/h. A large LCD just inside the door (on which I lean) alternates between showing the cities the train will stop at (and train and wagon number), and the current speed and time.

The countryside is whipping past but it really doesn't feel that fast, probably because of how smooth the ride is. Without the display I would not have guessed the rate of travel.  

Unlike our drive north to Minden (near Hannover), the land boardering the train line appears to be flat, fertile farmland. North of Frankfurt by car was quite hilly and forested with the exception of the small flat valleys surrounding the small towns.

After the exchange of passengers at Mannheim the train as full or more full than before.  It's great to see how many people use public transportation like this. A train between Calgary and Edmonton like this would be great, but only if the supporting public infrastructure within the city is sufficient to get people to their final destination. The expanded CTrain in Calgary is good, but still may not be sufficient. For example, the Ctrain does not go to the airport. Boo.

Just passed a pair of cooling towers for a nuclear power plant about halfway between Mannheim and Karlsruhe. The land is still pretty flat. Where there are no trees you can see quite far.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Karlsruhe is very calm and pleasant this Sunday afternoon. Going for a walk back to the market square to find some dinner. It is warm and a bit humid. Very green and I'm pleasantly amazed at how many bicycles there are. More bikes than cars it seems.

Sunday must be ice cream day. That is about all people are eating, and there are lineups to get it.  I didn't buy any.   

Monday morning walk. More cars, but still lots of bikes. Lady riding bike with cocker(?) in the basket behind the seat.  Have not seen a single person with a helmet. Even the postmen ride bikes.

Unlike France, no dogs on the street.

I didn't sleep horribly well. Too warm and my body didn't think it was the middle of the night. Finally a rain shower came by and the tapping of the drips distracted me from the guy snoring in the room next door. Woke up at 8:00 and felt pretty good despite the wakeful night. By 11:30 AM I'm feeling pretty bleary.

I finally found free WiFi so I'm making use of it. Too bad it's a 20 minute walk from the hotel.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Tonight we're having a joint dinner with the other half of the two-part team I'm on at our hotel. Once we finished our meetings for today I had two hours of spare time, and because I was too tired to run this morning, I decided to run in the heat (26 C). So I headed off on the route I took two mornings ago and then 2km along the way I decided to explore the trails through the forest I'd previously spotted. 

Always amazed at how many people ride bikes, I was equally surprised at the number of walkers, runners, and cyclists in the forest. A network of relatively straight paths cross cross a large forest area behind the university, castle, and cemetery. 

I felt great and my pace was quick but soon I started to succumb to the heat. My heart rate rose an though I didn't feel the need to slow my pace I knew I must if I were to make it "home". 

My ad-hoc forest loop ended up being just longer than 7.2 km and I set a new seasonal heart rate max (194 bpm). 

The best part?  The envealoping forest. Absolutely wonderful conditions I wish I lived closer to.
